Finally, years after it should have, Apple have opened the iBookstore to New Zealanders.  I'm very happy, and I imagine will spend significant money at the new Apple storefront on top of the money I already spend on books.  Despite the pleasure though I am still bitter.  There's really no good reason why its taken this long.  The problem, as always, is the greed of the middle-men.  Those who don't create, who don't publish, and who certainly don't deserve to be protected by law as they clip the ...</td>
