Finally, years after it should have, Apple have opened the iBookstore to New Zealanders.  I'm very happy, and I imagine will spend significant money at the new Apple storefront on top of the money I already spend on books.  Despite the pleasure though I am still bitter.  There's really no good reason why its taken this long.  The problem, as always, is the greed of the middle-men.  Those who don't create, who don't publish, and who certainly don't deserve to be protected by law as they clip the ...</td>

We have seen on a huge scale educators teaching to the assessment since there position, employment and in fact the fate of their schools rest on achieving a suitable level in assessment.

 I have been thinking about writing a blog post as to why I am a strong supporter of the consolidation of the two foundations into Apereo.

The annual survey of nearly 4,000 teaching faculty from all disciplines in higher education, representing U. S.  higher education professors, examined both the personal and professional impacts of social media.     Key finding...</td>

<h3>Info</h3>
<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section. The <em>raw scores</em> given are the fraction of words in each document that are found in the relevant lexicon. The ratings are an estimate of the size of the score compared to </p>
