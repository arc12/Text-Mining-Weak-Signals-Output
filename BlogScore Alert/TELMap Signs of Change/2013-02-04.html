 Up until now we have not had 24/7 learning.   Students  had to go to their laptops/computers and, then, do their work.    Their computers might be in their bedroom, in the family room, in a school  computer library or in a library computer lab.   The students had to be mobile, not the technology.  Now students can use the mobile device that they always have with them such as their smartphone to truly have 24/7 learning.  In the middle of the night, they can reach over to their night stand and u...</td>

  This week i&#8217;m away from work, skiing in Finland, so instead of the usual fare, i present a five part series on &#8216;the rebirth of knowledge&#8217;.  It&#8217;s a light hearted look at how our relationship with knowledge is changing: from something that we need to know, to something that we just know how to find out.  Today: truth.   A lengthy discussion the other day on the nature of truth: can you ever really prove anything? Well, today i certainly proved that i can&#8217;t type when...</td>

<a href="http://www.wonkhe.com/2013/01/25/the-postgraduate-problem" target="_top">The postgraduate problem?</a><br/>
 There is little doubt that we have a problem or two in postgraduate policy.  Fifty vice chancellors recently wrote to the Observer to say so.  BIS ministers have been asking for imaginative suggestions and are clear that they are very open to considering any new or ingenious ideas.  Well here&#8217;s one:  don&#8217;t do anything (or at least don&#8217;t do anything rash).  That might sound bizarre given the apparent decline in postgraduate numbers this year and the prospect that in a couple of...</td>

  Based on some pushback on my Storify of the conversation I held at EduCon about the &#8220;politics of ed-tech,&#8221; I wanted to expand and clarify my thoughts on the topic.  Plus, it was a pretty interesting week, with lots of great examples to talk about. . .        The most well-known of Melvin Kranzberg&#8217;s &#8220;6 laws of technology&#8221; states, &#8220;Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral. &#8221; One of Kranzberg&#8217;s less frequently cited laws adds, &#8220;A...</td>

 UKIP are on the rise.  Nigel Farage has become a permanent feature of political shows as recent polls have shown his party finding unprecedented levels of support.  UKIP has been consistently ahead of the Lib Dems, building support amongst discontented Conservative voters over issues such as the EU and gay marriage.  While the party does not have any MPs and will struggle with the first-past-the-post system (described rightly by Farage as &#8220;brutal to a party&#8221; like UKIP), it seems lik...</td>

<h3>Info</h3>
<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section. The <em>raw scores</em> given are the fraction of words in each document that are found in the relevant lexicon. The ratings are an estimate of the size of the score compared to </p>
