 Michael Feldstein has written an excellent post titled The Death and Rebirth of Sakai OAE.   Michael correctly celebrates the outstanding progress of the Apereo OAE Project.   The OAE presentations at the recent Apereo Conference were outstanding and the stakeholders and development team seem very well aligned.    These are all developments that make me more optimistic about OAE than I have ever been before.  But since I am an amateur historian and keenly interested in what it takes for Open So...</td>

There has been an interesting debate about the IPPR&#8217;s report &#8216;A Critical Path&#8216; on this blog and elsewhere over recent days.  My problems with the IPPR report relate to the lack of care taken with respect to loan accounting.  I hope that this post will layout these concerns clearly.  Higher Education policy around loans is only partially understood by cashflow models.  The debt used to finance the loans in the first place and its impact on the national balance sheet and departme...</td>

 I've been working with Leicester City Council's HR Department, in   consultation with secondary schools, to create a new school post -   Educational Technologist.  The career grade post - with three grades   defined - will be of particular interest to schools who make use of ICT   Managed Service provision, although schools who provide their ICT   Service in-house may be interested in how the new post sits within   existing or planned provision.  The overall purpose of the post is described as:...</td>

    I have a Mini Cooper (that's it under the snow - Winter IS Coming).  Great car.  Over 100K miles on it and I just keep putting oil, gas and tires in/on it and it just keeps going (knock on wood).  I've also had a lot of cars - not like a Jay Leno lot of cars but a regular amount I guess.  Here's the twist though - when I bought my Mini, one of the things that I got was a username/password to the "Mini Owner's Lounge". . . then when I was driving around, I noticed that other Mini drivers woul...</td>

      How time flies.  It is already in October 2012 that the report on Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion (DGEI) was published by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute of Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS).

<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section.
