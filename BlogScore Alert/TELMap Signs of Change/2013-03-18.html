The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) today released the results of its first annual  CoSN K-12 IT Leadership Survey , as the association kicks off its 2013 Annual Conference.   The survey polled district technology leaders nationwide to capture  technology trends, challenges and priorities surrounding K-12 technology  leadership.  According to the survey&#8217;s findings:  80% of      school district technology leaders predict flat or declining IT budgets      for the upcoming year.  The ...</td>

  For some time now I&#8217;ve sensed a split in the learning profession in terms of recognising the value and importance of self-managed learning as it takes place in the flow of daily work.  There are some who think that unless they have been responsible for an individual&#8217;s learning (i. e.  they have designed, delivered, tracked and managed the whole process), then it is of little relevance or consequence to the L&D department, and view self-organised team learning as a &#8220;work&#8221...</td>

 Someone I know in my Twitter circle tweeted this recently:  Good teaching and learning practice has nothing to do with policy by gordon joughin #edsg&#8212;Chew Han Lim (@chewhanlim1) March 07, 2013   I think that the point of the tweet is that in the grand scheme of things, policymakers and administrators do not really impact the interaction between a teacher and a student.  But do they? Policies can be very powerful.  Set an agenda for a return to basics and withhold funding to schools if the...</td>

 One of the conversations I got involved in at last week&#8217;s series of flipped presentations was how schools still attempt to police social media use.  I told the small group of teachers who were discussing the issue that they were barking up the wrong tree.  The discussion started with one teacher sharing how a student used Twitter to misrepresent, to humorous effect, what the school principal said at assemblies.  Teachers tried to scan the sea of student bodies to fish the perpetrator out....</td>
