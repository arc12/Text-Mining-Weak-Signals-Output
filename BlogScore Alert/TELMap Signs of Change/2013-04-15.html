<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section. The <em>raw scores</em> given are the fraction of words in each document that are found in the relevant lexicon. The ratings are an estimate of the size of the score compared to </p>
