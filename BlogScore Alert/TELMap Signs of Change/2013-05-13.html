 A week or so ago, I went looking for boundary lines for UK electoral wards, with half a mind towards trying to do something with them related to this week&#8217;s local council elections.  One source I came across was the UK 2011 Census, (2011 Census geography products for England and Wales) which publishes the appropriate data from across England and Wales in large single shapefiles.  For the amateur cartographer (which I very much am!) wanting to work at a local level, this presents something...</td>
