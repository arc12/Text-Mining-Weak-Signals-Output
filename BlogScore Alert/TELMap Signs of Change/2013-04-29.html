<strong>Learning in the Social Workplace</strong><br/>

 The Learning in the Workplace Survey  has now been taken by over 600 people, and although it is still open if you want to cast your vote, I am going to release some interim findings here today as the pattern of results has been pretty stable for some time now.  The survey asked respondents to rate  the importance (value/usefulness) of 10 different ways of learning for themselves.  The  red figures are where the most responses have been received.

 On Friday, the Age newspaper featured a story on how foreign fee paying students have become a lucrative income source for cash-strapped Victorian schools.  It&#8217;s coincidental because I&#8217;ve just caught up reading the February report by the International Education Advisory Council on the challenges and opportunities of Australia&#8217;s international education sector.  While the focus is predominately on expanding tertiary and VET sectors, there are some interesting statistics on the d...</td>

 Early last week the government announced the Open Standards Board had finally been convened via a press release from Francis Maude, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, and via a blog post from Liam Maxwell, the government's Chief Technology Office.

<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section. The <em>raw scores</em> given are the fraction of words in each document that are found in the relevant lexicon. The ratings are an estimate of the size of the score compared to </p>
