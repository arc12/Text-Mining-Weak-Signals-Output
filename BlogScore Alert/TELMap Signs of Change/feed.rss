		<description><![CDATA[There has been an interesting debate about the IPPR&#8217;s report &#8216;A Critical Path&#8216; on this blog and elsewhere over recent days.  My problems with the IPPR report relate to the lack of care taken with respect to loan accounting.  I hope that this post will layout these concerns clearly.  Higher Education policy around loans is only partially understood by cashflow models.  The debt used to finance the loans in the first place and its impact on the national balance sheet and departme...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    I have a Mini Cooper (that's it under the snow - Winter IS Coming).  Great car.  Over 100K miles on it and I just keep putting oil, gas and tires in/on it and it just keeps going (knock on wood).  I've also had a lot of cars - not like a Jay Leno lot of cars but a regular amount I guess.  Here's the twist though - when I bought my Mini, one of the things that I got was a username/password to the "Mini Owner's Lounge". . . then when I was driving around, I noticed that other Mini drivers woul...]]></description>
