     One question I get asked again and again by colleagues in the sector is how should institutions purchase apps for their iOS devices.  The easiest solution before, was to move the entire institution to the USA, buy the apps using the volume purchasing programme and then move back&#8230; What most people did was either: a) rely on free apps only, which was a pain if there were apps you wanted to buy or relied on in-app purchases.  b) spend their own money on apps, easy to do, but not everyone...</td>

<h3>Info</h3>
<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;. Sometimes a section is omitted from the alert; this occurs when there are no scores above threshold and at most 4 posts appear in any section. The <em>raw scores</em> given are the fraction of words in each document that are found in the relevant lexicon. The ratings are an estimate of the size of the score compared to </p>
