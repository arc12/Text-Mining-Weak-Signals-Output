 An electronics company has just won a patent claim against another electronics company.  It&#8217;s not relevant to this post which companies and what patent were involved, it just served to remind me once again of the different types of innovation that are subject to these patent claims&#8211;where there is a patent there is at least a claim of innovation, and that is what interests me.  Specifically, I find it interesting that some of these patent claims are for antenna design, others certain...</td>

<a href="http://ashleytan.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/edupreneurship" target="_top">Edupreneurship</a><br/>
 Mention edupreneurship and some teachers will respond negatively.  There is an almost righteous indignation among purists that one should teach for its own sake or only for the benefit of others.  It is true that most public schools are centrally funded and do not need to turn a financial profit.  But we fool ourselves if we think that we do not profit in some way.  Schools seek to build reputational capital, to recruit the best students, to attract the most beneficial partnerships, etc.  Unive...</td>

 Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve started pondering what sort of data sets might be &#8220;almost available&#8221; on local council websites, along with the extent to which we might be able to use these datasets to support transparency goals, such as generating signals about the extent of cuts to local council services, or developing data driven local services, such as pub finders;-) So for example, by chance I came across a page on my local council website detailing property the council is s...</td>

The one-sized-fits-all national requirements of No Child Left Behind would give way to standards that states write for themselves under legislation introduced by senators of both parties last week, with one key difference: The Republican version of the bill would eliminate the Education Department&#8217;s role in overseeing the standards and give governors the final say.  In stark contrast, the Democrats&#8217; version would mirror the NCLB waiver process already in place.  As of press time, 37 ...</td>

As President of Teachers College, Columbia University 1 , Dr.  Susan Fuhrman recently faced criticism on two fronts.  First, there was significant criticism (and even a quiet protest at graduation) over the decision to award theÂ TC Medal of Distinguished Service to New York State Regents Chancellor Merryl Tisch.  According to one petition to stop this award,   As Chancellor, Tisch has committed New York State&#8217;s public schools to high stakes testing, and has personally advocated for standar...</td>

<p>Documents are scored according to the occurrence of words in the following lexicons derived from the categories of the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a>: <a href="#Economic">Economic</a> combines &quot;Econ@&quot; and &quot;ECON&quot;,  <a href="#Legal">Legal</a> uses &quot;Legal&quot;, and <a href="#Political">Political</a> combines &quot;Polit@&quot; and &quot;POLIT&quot;.
