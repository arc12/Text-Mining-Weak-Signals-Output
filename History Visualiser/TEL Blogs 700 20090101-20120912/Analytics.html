This shows the history of the way certain terms have been used (related words are counted also, e.g. &quot;gaming&quot; would be counted as &quot;game&quot;). The chart loads up showing the trend in word-frequency for a term (or group of terms) with the line coloured to show the average &quot;positive sentiment&quot; of blog posts containing the term. &quot;Positive sentiment&quot; is calculated as the fraction of words that generally have either a positive connotation according to the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/">Harvard General Inquirer</a> dictionary. Calculations were conducted in 2 month slices and the number of blog posts per slice is (in date order): 1553, 1520, 1343, 1100, 1150, 1040, 1114, 1198, 990, 914, 1337, 1225, 1249, 984, 1056, 756, 1253, 1106, 1236, 991, 612, 675. True calculated values are plotted for the mid-point of each time slice to show the aggregate value over that 2 month period and spline interpolation is used to give the impression of a smooth change between these points. In total, 24402 blog posts were use</p>

<p><em>NB: be aware that insignificant fluctuations in the data may appear magnified since the plots are shown "zoomed in" (especially true for sentiment scores (or &quot;subjectivity&quot;, which is the sum of positive and negative sentiment). Also note that sentiment values are essentially meaningless when the frequency is close to the baseline.</em></p>
