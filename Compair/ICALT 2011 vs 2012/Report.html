<h1>Comparison: Conference Proceedings from ICALT in 2011 and 2012</h1>

<p>This is an un-interpreted and automatically-generated report to show the variation in terms used in

 the full text of papers from two conferences: <a href="http://www.ask4research.info/icalt/2011/">ICALT 2011</a> and <a href="http://icalt2012.scuolaiad.it/events/icalt2012/index.php">ICALT 2012</a>.
  A separate subsection shows those terms that appear more frequently in papers from each conference in turn.

Selection criteria based on statistical significance are used to determine which terms are selected; the probability that the difference in frequency might be due to pure chance must be less than 0.1% in addition to other criteria to select dominant terms (see "<a href="#info">technicalities</a>").

<p><em>All plots will open in a new window/tab as 1000x1000 pixel images if clicked on. The "Wordle" is 1024x768.</em></p>

<h2>Overview of Selected Terms</h2>
<p>Only middle-frequency words are considered; the comparison is between terms that are neither very common nor very rare in the aggregate of all papers being analysed.</p>
<div class="cap-img"><a href="AB Pre-sig Wordle.jpg" target="image_win"><img src="AB Pre-sig Wordle.jpg" alt="Word cloud of compared terms" width="600" height="450" /></a><BR/>

<strong>Frequency</strong> = the fraction of terms<br />
<strong>Significance</strong> = -log<sub>10</sub> of the probability that the difference in frequency between the conferences is "pure chance" (i.e. 3 is 1 in 1,000, 4 is 1 in 10,000 etc)<br/>
<strong>Docs/1000</strong> = the number of documents in the set that contain the term per thousand (colour code and area of square)<br/>

<strong>Node size</strong> = relative significance<br />
