<h1>Conference Scan: Rising and Falling Terms - Conference Proceedings from ICALT, CAL, ECTEL and ICWL 2010</h1>

<p>This is an un-interpreted and automatically-generated report on emerging, rising and falling terms from the abstracts of the 

   IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies,
 
   European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning,
 
   International Conference on Web-based Learning 
 
   and Computer Assisted Learning Conference.
 

It is one part of the <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/adam/2011/05/12/weak-signals-and-text-mining-i-an-introduction-to-weak-signals/">&quot;Weak Signals Analysis&quot; work of the TEL-Map Project</a>. The same analytical method is also applied to blogs, hence the term "document" is used in plots; this may be equated to an abstract in this report.</p>

<p><em>All plots will open in a new window/tab as 1000x1000 pixed images if clicked on.</em></p>
<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>The analysis involves the application of text mining to the abstracts of the conference proceedings. The set of abstracts from the target year (2010) is contrasted against a set from the previous 4 years. Pearson's "Chi Squared" test is applied to determine the probability that the frequency of terms in both of these two samples could be from the same hypothetical distribution. The probability that the difference in term frequency could be ascribed to chance - assuming this hypothesis is true - must be less than 0.5% for a term to be presented in this report. This is referred to as the "significance threshold" below.</p>

<p>Further informaton about the text mining process being used is <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/adam/2011/05/12/weak-signals-and-text-mining-ii-text-mining-background-and-application-ideas/">available elsewhere</a> but for the purpose of interpretation it should be noted that &quot;stemming&quot; and &quot;stop-word&quot; removal has been used. &quot;Stop-word&quot; removal means that common words are removed before beginning the analysis. &quot;Stemming&quot; involves the conversion of similar words that differ only by their ending into a truncated form that is used as the &quot;term&quot; in the analysis. For the purpose of readability the shortest word that produces the term is generally given, although sometimes the algorithm fails and the stemmed version is shown. This should be born in mind when examining the results.</p>

<p>Four views on the differences between the target and previous years' abstracts are presented:
<ul>
   <li><strong>New Terms</strong>, where this report highlights terms that meet the significance threshold and appear in at least 2 different recent abstracts but not at all in the previous years.</li>
   <li><strong>Rising Terms</strong>, where term frequency rises to a statistically-significant level. A term must appear in at least 2 different recent abstracts but must not have an average frequency of more than 0.02% in the previous years set. i.e. the Rising Terms view focusses on possible weak signals, possible <em>new</em> trends.</li>
   <li><strong>Established Terms</strong> are similar to "Rising Terms" but appear with a frequency of 0.02% or more on average in the previous years and hence are considered to be established upwards trends rather than indicators of a possible weak signal. Since this report is primarily concerned with Weak Signal detection, relatively little emphasis is given to Established Terms.</li>
   <li><strong>Falling Terms</strong>, are those terms showing a decrease between the previous years set and the recent abstracts that exceeds the significance threshold.</li>
</ul>
<em>For Rising, Established Falling Terms, the % change is calculated on the proportion of all stemmed words that are the term in question. For example if 2.00% of stemmed words in the previous years set was &quot;learn&quot; and 2.12% pertains to the current set, then the rise is 6%.</em>
</p>

<h2>Statistics and Overall Pattern</h2>
<h3>Corpus Statistics</h3>
<p>There are 328 abstracts in 2010 and 1635 in the 4 previous years. Within these abstracts, which define the corpus, there are 6411 distinct terms after removing stop words and applying stemming. The summary statistics for the number of times each term appears in the corpus are: mean=17.24, median=2, maximum=4186.</p>

<p>For the set of New Terms:
<ul>
   <li>the number of times each term appears in at least 2 different abstracts the target set but before applying the significance test has: mean=2.727, median=2, maximum=6.</li>
   <li>after selecting terms above the significance threshold, there are 15 terms in scope which appear in 24 out of the 328 target abstracts.</li>
</ul>

For the set of Rising Terms:
<ul>
   <li>the % rise from the previous years to the target year before applying the significance test has: mean=160.9, median=62.37, maximum=1848.</li>
   <li>after selecting terms above the significance threshold, there are 21 terms in scope which appear in 79 out of the 328 target abstracts.</li>
</ul>

The set of Falling Terms (the % fall from the previous years to the target year) before applying the singificance test has summary statistics of: mean=-88.93, median=-100, maximum=-0.07899.
</p>

<h2>Auxillary Measures of Interest</h2>
<p>In addition to the primary measures of interest - statistical significance and the percentage change - two more are calculated as an aid to judging the actual, as opposed to statistical, significance of differences between the previous years abstracts and the recent set. The auxillary measures apply to the abstracts and are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>, which is a measure of how unusual the abstract is, based on the terms appearing in it, compared to all other abstracts in the corpus.</li>
<li><strong>Subjectivity</strong>, which is a measure of the fraction of the words used that are listed as generally having either positive or negative sentiment associated with their occurrence (the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a> lexicon is used). A high Subjectivity is assumed to indicate the author's active interest rather than passive observation; active interest may correlate with weak signals. A subjectivity of 0.1 indicates 10% of the words (after removel of stopwords) have connotations of positive or negative sentiment.</li>
</ul>

<div class="cap-img"><a href="Images/AbsoluteNovelty.png" target="image_win"><img src="Images/AbsoluteNovelty.png" alt="Absolute Novelty" width="500" height="500" /></a><BR/>
Figure 4: Distribution of novelty measure among abstracts.<br/>Novelty= 1 - the minimum distance (specifically the cosine distance) between the abstract and any other abstract in 2010 and 1635 in the 4 previous years.</div>
<div class="cap-img"><a href="Images/StandardisedNovelty.png" target="image_win"><img src="Images/StandardisedNovelty.png" alt="Standardised Novelty" width="500" height="500" /></a><BR/>
Figure 5: Distribution of standardised novelty measure among abstracts.<br/>An abstract with median novelty will have a standardised novelty of 0 and a unique abstract a value of 1. Negative values indicate an abstract that has a closer &quot;neighbour&quot; than the median.</div>

<!--reset layout-->
<div class="clear"/>

<p>Since conference abstracts are quite short, hence contain few terms stopword removal, and the corpus size is modest, the Novelty Measure is typically skewed towards a high value. In this case it is not realistic to select out novel abstracts, whereas a high negative value for the Standardised Novely is a reasonalble indicator of similarity.</p>

<p><em>Note: In plots such as the above, where terms are shown they will usually be a short word but may occasionally be truncated or have an unusual ending. This is a consequence of the stemming process, where related words are rendered into a single form that is used in the processing. The word that actually occurs in a given abstract may be one of the related forms. The unusual endings occur when the reverse-lookup algorithm fails. It should also be noted that punctuation is removed so hyphenated forms become concatenated. An unfamiliar term may be an abbreviation or project/product acronym.</em></p>

<h2>Significant Established Terms</h2>
These are terms with a statistically-significant increase but with a freqency of 0.02% or more on average in the years prior to 2010 and hence are considered to be established upwards trends rather than indicators of a possible weak signal. Since this report is primarily concerned with Weak Signal detection, relatively little emphasis is given to Established Terms.

This paper presents the findings of a preliminary study about the use of bio-feedback sensors in the context of an educational hypermedia environment, skin conductance, blood volume pulse and heart rate physiological data were gathered. The aim of the study was to examine learners emotional arousal variability, and possible correlations of the physiological data with other psychological constructs such as trait and self-reported anxiety. Ten university students participated in two identical experiments, with a mixed between-within experimental design (20 samples). According to the findings, heart rate was significantly correlated with trait and self-reported state anxiety (in the second experiment), but not with academic performance in an on-line exam. Skin conductance and blood volume pulse had only marginal variations, perhaps due to the absence of intense stimuli.

Augmented Reality (AR) appears as a promising technology to improve students motivation and interest and support the learning and teaching process in educational contexts. We present the collaborative development of an AR application to support the teaching of the digestive and circulatory systems. We developed this system with the support of a private Spanish school. The main objective of the application is to show the student in primary school, in the most accurate way, digestive and circulatory systems. By other hand, we also develop our own AR library, HUMANAR, in order to ensure the integration of AR into our game engine and to overcome some drawbacks present in some public libraries. Moreover, our system provides several advantages over the traditional learning as books, videos or practice with animal organs.

The paper delineates the design of the animated agent with using Socratic dialogue to facilitate learning in game based learning environment (the biology adventure). Especially, the biology adventure is designed to model virtual scenarios of the human circulatory system. It presents natural phenomena and inquiry prompts to emphasize the conceptual knowledge of the human circulatory system. Specifically, the spatial aesthetics attract students in the interactive environment that represents the complex biology structure. It is the spirit of the game which students play as the biologist. Through the exploration, students interact with the animated agent to examine their concepts continuously as well as organize their mental models.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of prior computer knowledge and gender on high school novices learning of computer science concepts from instructional simulations designed based an experiential-based pedagogical perspective. There were 94 10th-graders taking the introductory course on computer science identified as the low and high prior computer knowledge in this study. Participants motivation and perceived-usefulness toward the employed instructional simulations and performance were evaluated. A quasi-experimental study was employed to examine the effects of prior computer knowledge and gender on dependent measures. The results indicated that (a) the high-prior-knowledge learners possessed higher motivation and perceived-usefulness toward the employed instructional simulations, (b) males revealed higher motivation and perceived-usefulness than females, (c) females outperformed males on the performance evaluation, and finally, (d) the low prior computer knowledge learners performed as well as the high-prior-knowledge learners while learning from instructional simulations.

Local reuse detection is a prerequisite for a multitude of tasks ranging from document management and information retrieval to web search or plagiarism detection. Its results can be used to support authors in creating new learning resources or learners in finding existing ones by providing accurate suggestions for related documents. While the detection of local text reuse, i.e. reuse of parts of documents, is covered by various approaches, reuse detection for object-based documents has been hardly considered yet. In this paper we propose a new fingerprinting technique for local reuse detection for both text-based and object-based documents which is based on the contiguity of documents. This additional information, which is generally disregarded by existing approaches, allows the creation of shorter and more flexible fingerprints. Evaluations performed on different corpora have shown that it performs better than existing approaches while maintaining a significantly lower storage consumption.

The objectives of this paper are to explore the characteristics of patterns of participation in social and game-play spaces outside the classroom of 10 fifteen-year-olds engaging in mobile game-based learning, and to determine whether there are gender differences in their use of social and game-play spaces. The data indicate some evidence of gender differences in their use. The boys in the study tended to engage in mobile game-based learning more than girls in game-play spaces. The girls tended to use the social space more than the boys and were especially more active in their use of the in-game chat system.

This study investigated players motivation during serious game play. It is based on a theoretical model of motivation. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase of motivation during the game. This study tried to dissect predictors of Players Motivational States. Multiple linear regression showed statistical significance of specific electrophysiological data. The theta wave in the frontal regions and motivation were positively correlated. High-beta wave in the left-center region was also a significant predictor for high level of motivation. Skin conductance was also a significant predictor for motivation. However, we could not find a significant correlation between players motivation and their heart rate responses.

The purpose of this study is to explore a chorus learning support environment based on the tutoring knowledge of the chorus leader. In general chorus practice, a chorus leader tends to instruct his chorus members based not on score information, but a chorus leaders sense of value and/or his musical philosophy. We try to extract the tutoring knowledge necessary to evaluate/review a singing voice from the chorus leader. The extracted knowledge is expressed in a computational form and implemented in a learning support system. In this paper, a chorus learning support system is proposed. At first, the tutoring knowledge of a chorus leader is described. Next, the architecture and functions of the proposed system are shown. Finally, we evaluate the adequacy of the extracted knowledge and the effectiveness of chorus learning with our system.

This paper presents the findings of a preliminary study about the use of bio-feedback sensors in the context of an educational hypermedia environment, skin conductance, blood volume pulse and heart rate physiological data were gathered. The aim of the study was to examine learners emotional arousal variability, and possible correlations of the physiological data with other psychological constructs such as trait and self-reported anxiety. Ten university students participated in two identical experiments, with a mixed between-within experimental design (20 samples). According to the findings, heart rate was significantly correlated with trait and self-reported state anxiety (in the second experiment), but not with academic performance in an on-line exam. Skin conductance and blood volume pulse had only marginal variations, perhaps due to the absence of intense stimuli.

In this paper, we propose to introduce the self-esteem component within learning process. More precisely, we explore the effects of learner self-esteem conditioning in a tutoring system. Our approach is based on a subliminal priming method aiming at enhancing implicit self-esteem. An experiment was conducted while participants were outfitted with biofeedback device. Three physiological sensors were used to continuously monitor learners affective reactions namely electroencephalogram, skin conductance and blood volume pulse sensors. The purpose of this work is to analyze the impact of self-esteem conditioning on learning performance on one hand and learners emotional and mental states on the other hand.

In recent years, E-learning has become a popular research topic with its wide applications. As an important factor of E-learning, concept map is a powerful way to manage knowledge. In this paper, we describe our approach for determining a compact concept map of an input dance motion obtained from the 3D motion capture technology. The dance motion is analyzed to extract the repetitive patterns and then the prerequisite relations are computed as the inclusion relation among patterns. A concept map can then be constructed automatically for illustrating such relations. The transitive reduction algorithm is applied to remove the redundant edges such that the resulting concept map retains a compact representation of the dance structure. This concept map can be used to generate dance lessons such that a learner can learn the dance motion in a step-by-step and logical manner.

This research provides students a three-phased English essay reading scaffolding support system by leading them through a systematic process. By integrating Reading annotator, a web-based annotation system for reading support, the system can help students know how to enhance their reading abilities. Reading annotator helps students visual interactively to analyze basic structure of essays by identifying key elements of each paragraph such as topic sentence, controlling idea, and supporting details. Based on the key elements of each paragraph, a process-oriented structure-based scaffolding support environment is developed to help students know how to read essays with various rhetorical forms step-by-step by analyzing the essay organizations. The system applies not only text structure, visual representations, summarization, and questions reading strategies but also reading to summarize and reading to analyze reading levels. Moreover, the proposed system accommodates the scaffolding strategies such as providing procedural facilitator, guided learning, using external representational scaffolds, helping the student focus thinking on only those items that were important for the task.

Classroom usually has a timetable plate embedded on the wall near the front door. However, the only purpose for displaying classrooms timetable cannot fulfill the future digital classroom requirement. They need more automatic, integrated, and intelligent functionality in the classroom environment. Besides, the vision of future smart classroom is to select sustainable technology solutions that have the possibilities of dramatically improving the instructional delivery process and to engage the student in their learning experience. Therefore, the aspiration for providing more intelligent capability will go back to the improvement of classroom environment itself. Within the classroom, how to create a smart space is our goal. By means of introducing smart timetable plate, we can create a new use case for the application of smart classroom. The creative model not only bring the new style school living but also encourage the reform of traditional classroom environment.

Learning and teaching is often supported using presentation software to display pre-authored slides in sequence over time. We wish to consider the pedagogic implications of Multi-Display Learning Spaces (MD-LS), where multiple partitions of presented information overlay a larger area within the physical environment. We discuss the use in university teaching of the Multi-Slides plug-in for popular presentation software, along with multiple projectors, to cascade multiple slides of information simultaneously across two walls of a seminar room. We use examples derived from postgraduate teaching to argue that MD-LS allow for enabling juxtapositions of visual materials  which can be used by students and tutors as cognitive tools to promote reasoned, argumentational dialogue. We consider the spatial implications for learning, and relate MD-LS to attempts within the literature to conceive classrooms of the future.

This paper explores two classes of emerging technology that offer the promise to provide radically improved ways to support lifelong learning. We particularly focus on the human computer interaction (HCI) challenges that must be addressed if that promise is to be realised. One technology is personalisation, based on a long term learner model which captures the learners knowledge, preferences and other attributes. We discuss the roles of an explicit learner model that is a first class software entity, with APIs for programmers as well as effective user interfaces that can give users control over their model and its use. We present the PLUS framework that provides the infrastructure for personalised learning, and how its Accretion-Resolution representation supports both flexible reasoning for personalisation by programs and provides the foundation for users to control the whole personalisation process. We link the PLUS framework to a second class of technology, the fast-changing and increasingly ubiquitous personal mobile devices and the emerging embedded surface computing devices, such as tabletop and shared wall displays. We show how we have tackled several of the HCI challenges that are key to both these technologies.

This paper is based on the theme `Virtual Worlds for Academic, Organizational, and Life-Long Learning. It reports the implications on informal learning through a research that uses 3D digital simulations of proposed streetscape design schemes for the main boulevard of Putrajaya, Malaysia. The exercise was in consideration of the organizational focus of Putrajaya, the new administrative capital of Malaysia, to utilize electronic governance in its day-to-day operation. Besides gauging the publics receptivity to the design proposals and digital approach, consulting the public using the digital simulations in a participative design spirit is interpreted as a potential aspect of e-governance. The paper looks at the ramifications on communication and acquisition of new knowledge for the public and the students-researchers primarily and the city authority secondarily. The insights will highlight aspects to consider in implementing this process of digital-based participative design in the future.

The tracks analysis concerning students actions logged by Technology Enhanced Learning systems can help teacher to improve their pedagogical scenarios making them relevant to students. Besides, sharing and reusing teachers know-how and experience in the session analysis of learning systems also facilitate their scenario enhancement. In this paper, we present our proposal for obtaining these goals. We first describe the calculation method of pedagogical indicators from the tracks collected using the Usage Tracking Language and Data Combination Language. Then, we present our developed tool which allows executing these indicators. We also present results which validate our proposal with the tracks from the real learning environment. Our approach can be used to support engineering and re-engineering of pedagogical scenarios in Technology Enhanced Learning systems.

Lack of overall ecological knowledge structure is a critical reason for learners failure in keyword-based search. To address this issue, this paper firstly presents the dynamic location-aware and semantic hierarchy (DLASH) designed for the learners to browse images, which aims to identify learners current interesting sights and provide adaptive assistance accordingly in ecological learning. The main idea is based on the observation that the species of plants and animals are discontinuously distributed around the planet, and hence their semantic hierarchy, besides its structural similarity with WordNet, is related to location information. This study then investigates how different cognitive styles of the learners influence the use of DLASH in their image browsing. The preliminary results show that the learners perform better when using DLASH based image browsing than using the Flickr one. In addition, cognitive styles have more effects on image browsing in the DLASH version than in the Flickr one.

E-learning has made considerable progress in the last decades allowing different kinds of adaptation to the student profile or the learning objectives. But few E-learning standards take accessibility into account, making learners with disabilities find difficulties taking full advantage of E-learning platforms. Besides, most E-learning platforms present tests in a traditional format regardless of their known limitations, more important for applicants with special needs. However, it could be possible to integrate adaptive and more accessible E-testing functionalities in the E-learning platforms. This paper discusses the process of developing such an adaptive testing approach, which could be integrated in the Moodle platform, by presenting some of its principles, architectural elements and algorithms.

The integration of existing educational computer-based tools is a current research trend aimed at increasing the range of learning situations that can be supported by most widely adopted Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). Nevertheless, due to the technological and functional heterogeneity of both tools and VLEs, there is an integration cost that must be assumed and that varies depending on several design issues. This paper identifies the issues to be tackled when designing a VLE or a tool and the effects that the different alternatives may have in the integration cost. Besides, the paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of previous research proposals when dealing with such issues. The final goal is to understand the impact of design decisions in the chances for acceptance of the adopted integration approaches.

While todays learning management systems (LMSs) provide lot of support for teachers to assist them in holding online courses, they typically do not consider students individual differences in the composition and structure of courses. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for extending LMSs functionality to provide learners with courses that fit their individual learning styles, using adaptive sorting and adaptive annotation in order to highlight the learning objects (LOs) that support students learning process the best. The mechanism enables teachers to add adaptivity to their already existing courses, using a flexible course structure in order to avoid limiting the richness of the learning resources and materials. Besides being flexible to teachers needs, the adaptive mechanism aims at asking teachers for as little as possible additional effort when using it, requiring teachers only to choose the corresponding type of LO when creating an LO in the authoring tool of the LMS.

Nowadays, the practice of different teaching methodologies is easier thanks to the technology-enhanced learning systems. However, in order to effectively center the learning process in the student it should be adapted to the students progress. Adaptive e-learning systems have been proved to be valuable tools, which facilitate this adaptation. QUESTOURnament, an active and competitive Moodle tool, is being re-designed in order to become an adaptive system. One of the first steps in this adaptation is the estimation of the difficulty level of the questions proposed in this environment. This paper describes a solution based on a genetic algorithm with enhanced diversity methods that automatically characterizes the answers to the challenges. The algorithm has been tested with data registered from a contest made in a Telecommunications Engineering course. It finds diverse good solutions, from which several rules can be defined to classify the questions according to their difficulty level.

The study reports a highly interactive classroom environment in which the students do not use the desktop, laptop or PDA with keyboard, mouse, or pen, but the hand-motion as an input method. The classroom setting is no more one student with one computer, but the whole class with a large shared display and all the students interact with their peers on the display waving their hand and competing with each other simultaneously. Twelve undergraduate students were involved in this study, and their competitive preferences were elaborated. The usability test indicated that the system was acceptable, and the sociability evaluation showed that the classroom climate was changed dramatically.

Competition is a powerful motivator in game-based learning but direct competition might bring negative influences on students when they lose the competition, such as damage to confidence. In this paper, we propose an approach to alleviate such negative influences-learning by pet-training competition, which provides an indirect competition environment to enhance students to learn through training their pets. That is, students learn Chinese idioms in a pet-training game scenario, and their mastery is related to the pets strength to win the competition. In such environment, the competition result might be regarded as a matter whether students spend enough time in learning. This attribution might alleviate the negative influence that results from the direct competition.

This paper presents the design, development and testing of an e-assessment system, focusing on the practical part of the Medical School training. It also discusses several important aspects that need to be taken into consideration when creating an e-learning application for the medical domain. For example, the application must accustom the student with certain procedure protocols, it must be available to as many scholars as possible and it must be appealing in order for the students to exercise a greater amount of time. The results indicate that case-bcase-based virtual patient systemsased virtual patient systems can help prepare experts in the medical field with low costs and without allowing patients to be treated by still-training doctors.

A set of new types of assessment is required for learning management systems (LMSs), and there is a need for a way to assess lifelong adaptive competencies. Proposed solutions to these problems need to preserve the interoperability, reusability, efficiency and abstract modeling already present in LMSs. This paper introduces a set of software tools for an author assessment package on the LMS Mooddle being developed as part of adaptive e-learning engine architecture (AEEA). The principal features of this set are: 1) The set avoid editing items for a 360-degree feedback evaluation, 2) Whole items and tests are linked to levels of competencies acquisition, 3) The competency-based e-assessment data model are based on e-learning specification and complemented with XML data on the appraised competencies, 4) Items and tests are storage in repositories, and 5) The tools are integrated within Moodle to facilitate the design of an assessment plan.

Formative eAssessment can be very helpful in providing high quality higher education assignments. However, there are obstacles restricting the uptake of formative eAssessment in higher education including both cultural and technical issues. When a university is encouraging the uptake of formative eAssessment internally it is useful to have case studies from academic schools detailing how academics enthusiastic about formative eAssessment have used it in their modules. It is particularly helpful if these case studies document: i.) the principle obstacles that these champions had to deal with, ii.) a cooperative-design process through which these obstacles have been dealt with by the champions (with assistance from e.g. learning technologists), and iii.) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting formative eAssessments. However there is a shortage of such real-world long-term case studies. This paper helps fill this gap in the literature by describing the case of a Modern Languages module within a Russell Group university (Southampton). The formative eAssessment solution resulting from the case study utilises our QTI, mobile QTI, accessibility, and web 2.0 tools and can be positioned at the cutting edge of formative eAssessment practice. We have evaluated this with undergraduate student volunteers from Spanish modules and received positive feedback.

This paper presents a prototype for an augmented-reality based toy. Toys++ is grounded on the concept that the actual activity of building tangible artifacts can speed up learning processes. Toys ++ aims at assembling a framework that will allow the use of existing physical components of the toy as triggers. When the toy is placed under the webcam, a pre-trained 3D feature recognition system scans the entire figure, trying to identify some specific components. If any of these elements are recognized, the system will retrieve and show educational content from selected sources (texts, videos, pictures).

Through a pedagogically meaningful process of game-play, content, skills and attitudes can be integrated in the gaming environment to engage learners and enhance learning by game-play. This study examined the process of game-play from the perspective of knowledge transformation. Pedagogical perspectives were proposed to serve as learning frameworks for learning from game-play. It is suggested that effective knowledge transformation in the learners can be achieved by means of deliberate design of the game-play process as well as the role of the learners.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of prior computer knowledge and gender on high school novices learning of computer science concepts from instructional simulations designed based an experiential-based pedagogical perspective. There were 94 10th-graders taking the introductory course on computer science identified as the low and high prior computer knowledge in this study. Participants motivation and perceived-usefulness toward the employed instructional simulations and performance were evaluated. A quasi-experimental study was employed to examine the effects of prior computer knowledge and gender on dependent measures. The results indicated that (a) the high-prior-knowledge learners possessed higher motivation and perceived-usefulness toward the employed instructional simulations, (b) males revealed higher motivation and perceived-usefulness than females, (c) females outperformed males on the performance evaluation, and finally, (d) the low prior computer knowledge learners performed as well as the high-prior-knowledge learners while learning from instructional simulations.

This paper reports the first evaluation of a diagnostic module, called ACDC (Automatic Class Diagrams Comparator) since its integration into Diagram, a learning environment for UML class diagrams. ACDC is an hybrid matcher that compares the student diagram with a reference diagram and tries to match them. It produces a list of structural and content differences between these two diagrams. These differences are then analysed by the pedagogical component of Diagram for producing appropriate feedbacks. The evaluation of ACDC system was conducted using diagnosis traces and student diagrams collected in a Diagram experimentation during Fall 2008 with students in a UML course. For evaluating the quality of ACDC, we use four match quality measures: Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Overall. The evaluation results show that the diagnosis are fairly well but requires to be improved in some specific situations.

Several online repositories make available learning resources known as Learning Objects (LOs), and tasks such as identifying useful metadata, diminishing the annotation effort, and facilitating LOs discovery and retrieval, remain still as open challenges. Advanced searching techniques such as recommending systems have been studied to address these issues, though mainly focused on students. We focus on teachers and exploit their context in order to identify metadata that describes LOs content. Teachers profiles consider also such metadata in a hybrid approach for recommending LOs to teachers and instructors.

Hybrid Learning is becoming one of important applications by integrating e-learning and traditional face-to-face instruction together. As an introduction to the reader the challenges in hybrid learning of physical education and architecture of Physical Education Hybrid Learning Platform (PEHLP) are firstly provided. The main character of PEHLP is using video instead of textual information as learning material. Then Video Review Module (VRM) is presented. Through the annotation composing functionality of VRM, the teacher can review the students actions video, pick out the wrong actions and add still annotations, which for now are either text or specific graphic symbols or audio-recording. And through the annotation viewing/browsing functionality, the student can watch annotated video, find out mistakes and get instructions. In order to control over bandwidths and promote video annotation, the geometry primitives of video annotation graphic symbols are presented in Geometry Primitive Language (GPL) in XML. The experiment shows that the annotation data is 0.37% of the annotation data in JPG format. The user case of this paper shows that 80.9% out of students think that the video review can afford the hybrid learning of physical education, but only 66.7% of them think the hybrid learning instruction mode can attain the same teaching effect in contrasted F2F instruction mode. So we suggest that the proportion of e-learning should be less than 60% in hybrid learning of physical education course.

A nationwide sample of university students completed a survey that asked questions about their perceptions of the factors that can cause problems which exist with online or general group work. Data were obtained from 173 students at more than 18 different universities in the United Kingdom. Three main problems that exist in group collaboration are identified through an extensive review of literature and addressed as problem scenarios in the survey. These include: poor motivation, lack of individual accountability and negative interdependence. Findings from the survey include that on average more than five factors are acknowledged by the students for each subcategory of problem, and for each scenario the factors that affect the group work are ranked by importance level. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant association between the students backgrounds and their perceptions of the factors identified.

This paper demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be used to identify differences in how students and staff perceive the opinions contained in feedback for programming work. The feedback considered in this paper is conceptually different in that it is given in the form of tags that when associated with a fragment of source code can be considered as a sharable learning resource. The research presented investigates the differences in perception of whether feedback is positive, negative or neutral according to students and examiners. This paper also investigates the adequacy of an automated sentiment analysis engine with a view that sentiment information when combined with the feedback tag and source code may create a more informative sharable learning resource. This paper describes the investigatory technique and presents the initial results. Results indicate that there are important differences between the sentiment of feedback perceived by students and examiners. This paper highlights the benefit of including sentiment data along with feedback.

We present a study which compares human-human computer-mediated tutoring with two computer tutoring systems based on the same materials but differing in the type of feedback they provide. Our results show that there are significant differences in interaction style between human-human and human-computer tutoring, as well as between the two computer tutors, and that different dialogue characteristics predict learning gain in different conditions. We show that there are significant differences in the non-content statements that students make to human and computer tutors, but also to different types of computer tutors. These differences also affect which factors are correlated with learning gain and user satisfaction. We argue that ITS designers should pay particular attention to strategies for dealing with negative social and metacognitive statements, and also conduct further research on how interaction style affects human-computer tutoring.

In this paper, we study the issue of free-riding in collaborative learning. Free-riding occurs when a part of the students lean on the efforts of the rest of their team and do not contribute much to the team work. It impacts negatively on performances of the whole team [1]. We present an experiment of collaborative diagram drawing (through a synchronous collaborative drawing tool, called Shared Drawing tool) in a Software Engineering course, that shows a significant equal participation and suggests that students employ some self-regulatory behaviors that results in fruitful collaboration.

Oral reading fluency is essential to overall reading achievements and repeat reading has been found to be an effective strategy for oral reading fluency. Choral reading is the most authentic use of repeated readings in the EFL primary grades. However, teachers have neither sufficient time nor adequate expertise to deal with non-fluent readers. Hence, challenges with oral reading fluency and motivation have long been considered a common characteristic for teacher and students. Hence, this study proposed a one-to-one Audio Book Platform incorporating repeated reading strategy and record-play function. An intact sample of two classes of the sixth graders in Taiwan were randomly assigned and treated as experimental group and control (choral reading) group. An empirical study is conducted to assess whether there are differences in the effectiveness of enhancing oral reading fluency. A questionnaire elicited information concerning motivation included (1) anxiety, (2) intrinsic goal orientation, (3) extrinsic goal orientation, (4) task value, and (5) self-regulation is also conducted. Although no significant difference was uncovered in oral reading fluency and motivation, the findings could serve as some general principles for researchers who would like to experiment with one-to-one repeated reading in similar contexts.

This paper presents a pedagogical strategy for the exploration of blended-learning in higher education. A key component is the adoption of Open Space Technology (OST) to group students according to their motivation for the topics to be studied and tasks to be performed, rather than following their personal affinities. We have developed and tested the strategy throughout two academic years. In the first year, we explored OST in its regular, face-to-face, approach. Although the results were good, we felt that learning could be further improved with a period of on-line discussion after the face-to-face session. With this in mind, in the following year we explored a combination of face-to-face and on-line activities, in what we called blended-OST (or b-OST). We concluded that this approach could lead to a deeper discussion of the proposed tasks, to the emergence of additional possible tasks, and to the participation of students who tended to shy away from expressing their opinions orally. The data collected shows that the involvement of the students increased in the second year. In our view, the use of blended-OST has contributed to the creation of a better learning context. The students opinions, collected after the course, also support this view.

Although the potential benefits of using digital video in educational settings is well researched, little work has been conducted into how video modelling and messaging technologies can be devised and implemented to support teaching in educational settings. Video is generally used as a passive medium  whereby students watch a video presentation to ascertain information. In this paper we present Winkball for Schools, a new internet-based video messaging and broadcasting technology designed to support the teaching of oral and visual communication skills in schools. Through the use of video modelling instructional techniques and video messaging communications technologies we show how video can be deployed as an active medium to engage students when learning communication skills. Using Winkball for Schools students can record, send and share video messages with other students in classroom settings, at home and with students at different schools. Students can also create and post content to video notice boards for group viewing. It is hoped that through the wide scale adoption of Winkball technology the teaching of oral and visual communication skills within schools can benefit, and relationships between students in different countries can be further established.

Extensible Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and Cloud Learning Environments (CLEs) that facilitate the lone or collaborative study of user-chosen blends of content and courses from heterogeneous sources, including Open Educational Resources (OERs), are gradually gaining ground in the landscape of distance learning. In this paper, we examine the use of ontologies for modelling and supporting learner activities within a PLE or CLE that draws upon sources whose ontologies may vary a lot. In particular, we propose an architecture for layering and integration of learning ontologies modelling various aspects of the learning process and facilitating the production of recommendations to learners.

A Personal Learning Environment (PLE) is a mash-up of learning services. It enables students and teachers to assemble a work environment that is adapted to a domain and specific individual needs. In this article, we report on our experiences on using a PLE for Language Learning in five French lectures at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Continuing Education School. We found that while a PLE has the potential to simplify access to and usage of Web sites and services for language learning, students will use it only if properly motivated. Furthermore, at the time being, difficulties that result from the user interface and technical implementation make the interactions with PLEs difficult. The problems need to be overcome in order for PLEs to become adopted by the average, not technically highly literate students and teachers.

A number of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) exist on the market today. A subset of a LMS is the component in which student assessment is managed. In some forms of assessment, such as open questions, the LMS is incapable of evaluating the students responses and therefore human intervention is necessary. In order to assess at higher levels of Blooms (1956) taxonomy, it is necessary to include open-style questions in which the student is given the task as well as the freedom to arrive at a response without the comfort of recall words and/or phrases. Automating the assessment process of open questions is an area of research that has been ongoing since the 1960s. Earlier work focused on statistical or probabilistic approaches based primarily on conceptual understanding. Recent gains in Natural Language Processing have resulted in a shift in the way in which free text can be evaluated. This has allowed for a more linguistic approach which focuses heavily on factual understanding. This study will leverage the research conducted in recent studies in the area of Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval in order to provide a fair, timely and accurate assessment of student responses to open questions based on the semantic meaning of those responses.

This paper summarises the analyses of participant interaction within the Twitter microblogging environment. The study employs longitudinal probabilistic social network analysis (SNA) techniques to identify the patterns and trends of network dynamics. It explores the associations of student achievement records with the observed network. The results indicate tendencies towards: [i] reciprocal interaction, and [ii] adoption of a selective approach in communication over time, implying that students tend to communicate with fewer peers over time. The evaluations that examine achievement score attributes indicate [iii] network homogeneity and popularity effects associated to achievement scores - suggesting greater interaction among students of similar levels and more attention to higher achieving students.

This paper proposes an efficient probabilistic indexing scheme called P robabilistic R etrieval-Tree(PR-Tree) to facilitate a efficient probabilistic retrieval of Chinese calligraphic manuscript images based on triple features such as contour points, character styles and number of strokes. To the best of our understanding, this is first work on probabilistic retrieval over Chinese character. Different from conventional character retrieval and indexing methods [18] which only adopts shape similarity as a query metric, our proposed indexing algorithm allows user to choose the above three kinds of features as query elements. Moreover, a probabilistic model is introduced into the character retrieval process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed retrieval and indexing methods respectively.

This paper is based on the theme `Virtual Worlds for Academic, Organizational, and Life-Long Learning. It reports the implications on informal learning through a research that uses 3D digital simulations of proposed streetscape design schemes for the main boulevard of Putrajaya, Malaysia. The exercise was in consideration of the organizational focus of Putrajaya, the new administrative capital of Malaysia, to utilize electronic governance in its day-to-day operation. Besides gauging the publics receptivity to the design proposals and digital approach, consulting the public using the digital simulations in a participative design spirit is interpreted as a potential aspect of e-governance. The paper looks at the ramifications on communication and acquisition of new knowledge for the public and the students-researchers primarily and the city authority secondarily. The insights will highlight aspects to consider in implementing this process of digital-based participative design in the future.

Augmented Reality (AR) appears as a promising technology to improve students motivation and interest and support the learning and teaching process in educational contexts. We present the collaborative development of an AR application to support the teaching of the digestive and circulatory systems. We developed this system with the support of a private Spanish school. The main objective of the application is to show the student in primary school, in the most accurate way, digestive and circulatory systems. By other hand, we also develop our own AR library, HUMANAR, in order to ensure the integration of AR into our game engine and to overcome some drawbacks present in some public libraries. Moreover, our system provides several advantages over the traditional learning as books, videos or practice with animal organs.

This paper addresses questions of contextual learning experience sharing among users in personal learning environments. As learning environments has become personal and user oriented, a user can acquire knowledge and learning experiences anywhere and anytime by reading public or personal online learning resources aggregated by a set of provided tools. In this paper, we propose a system allowing a user to share his contextual learning experiences with his/her friends by sharing his contextual learning histories. This experience is propagated to others by using a trusted social network. Our system not only helps users to spread their learning experiences but also ensures user privacy (individual knowledge and preferences). It can be applied to enhance lifelong learning.

Student engagement is a pervasive and persistent goal for educators. In previous work we have reported that activities like public real-time commenting on videos can enhance student participation and engagement. However, these events occur over a limited period of time. Thus a more challenging question is how to increase and sustain student engagement. In this paper we describe the iterative development of Class Commons, a public commenting system with which students can post questions/comments that are shared through a public display in the classroom. The system was used in a senior undergraduate class in the spring semester of 2009. Our findings suggest that students were interested in this system. Students with different self-construal (independent vs. interdependent) appropriate this system for slightly different purposes. In the long run, we speculate that by having the teacher involved more in using this system (responding more quickly, helping structuring the discussions), it has potential for promoting sustained student engagement.

Informal or free-choice learning has become a well-established means of disseminating knowledge to school classrooms over the last years. Various technology-enhanced public spaces, like science centers and cultural heritage museums, are nowadays equipped with state-of-the-art digital dome theaters, where groups of people (mainly children) attend educational programmes. The overwhelming majority of such  include astronomical phenomena and in few cases cultural heritage. In this paper, we investigate the potential learning benefit of integrating audience interaction with gaming environments in the immersive space of a dome theater. In order to achieve this, we examine how six factors of the Contextual Model of Learning proposed by Falk and Dierking, can be applied in an integrated schema of group interactivity and game design in immersive learning environments.

Many users want to author assessment items directly from web pages. Existing authoring tools usually use the clipboard to perform the `select-copy-paste operation on web pages. Because web pages have complicated structures and can include invisible resources, the clipboard-based approach has several limitations: 1) it cannot keep the resource in its original form, 2) it cannot select invisible resources, and 3) it may have to select unnecessary resources. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes dinsEditor as a browser-based approach for assessment item authoring tools. It is offered as a browser extension that allows the authoring environment to make full use of the resources of web pages and to utilize the exact resources user want. It enables web resources to be maintained in their original form during the assessment item authoring process. The assessment items created through dinsEditor observe the QTI standard by using the QTI Translator.

E-Learning is the modern model of education, transferring the classical text books to an electronic medium giving us the opportunity to learn almost anytime, anywhere. It has become an important stream of education in present and has a promising future. Successful e-learning applications for efficient language teaching require various corpora and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This paper deals with the application of NLP technology and IMS QTI standard to construct an online Arabic learning environment for learners. Our work is an integration of two areas: linguistics computer science. It focuses on three objectives: the development of linguistics resources and tools for the automatic processing of Arabic, the building of ontology for the Arabic language and the application and extension of the IMS-QTI for Arabic grammar as well.

Formative eAssessment can be very helpful in providing high quality higher education assignments. However, there are obstacles restricting the uptake of formative eAssessment in higher education including both cultural and technical issues. When a university is encouraging the uptake of formative eAssessment internally it is useful to have case studies from academic schools detailing how academics enthusiastic about formative eAssessment have used it in their modules. It is particularly helpful if these case studies document: i.) the principle obstacles that these champions had to deal with, ii.) a cooperative-design process through which these obstacles have been dealt with by the champions (with assistance from e.g. learning technologists), and iii.) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting formative eAssessments. However there is a shortage of such real-world long-term case studies. This paper helps fill this gap in the literature by describing the case of a Modern Languages module within a Russell Group university (Southampton). The formative eAssessment solution resulting from the case study utilises our QTI, mobile QTI, accessibility, and web 2.0 tools and can be positioned at the cutting edge of formative eAssessment practice. We have evaluated this with undergraduate student volunteers from Spanish modules and received positive feedback.

E-learning content material can be classified as text and multimedia. A common practice is to use text as backbone and multimedia as components to enrich the otherwise text-and-still-images-only documents. Nowadays e-learning content delivery over learning management systems (LMS) is becoming a common practice in academic institutions. Common authoring tools like office suites are good to generate printing format but at present they do not generate easily the interoperable standards used today in LMS (i.e. SCORM, IMS CP and IMS QTI). We propose a user friendly authoring environment to produce IMS interoperable formats, able to be imported in our Sakai based LMS named PoliformaT. We follow the text-based-multimedia-enriched document paradigm using Docbook for text and SMIL for multimedia composition. Both Docbook and SMIL are independent and XML compliant. Docbooks simple and well structured markup simplifies interoperability with other XML compliant languages, particularly those related to e-learning. In the multimedia side SMIL offers an open and flexible composition capability to author multimedia content for e-learning. The problem that we face with the proposed approaches is the lack of friendly and productive authoring tools. This is the issue we intend to contribute to with this work.

Within the framework of APOGE project, we want to demonstrate the usability of semantic metadata, when they are provided, during the authoring phase to assist authors to improve the consistency of new designed learning objects. The added value of our approach is maximized in the case of SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) like learning objects authoring. Indeed, when we have learning objects designed by reuse of existing ones there is risks to have weaknesses mainly due to a bad understanding of the true nature of the reused objects. To overcome those risks we have defined an automated authoring assistance approach. In this paper we put the emphasis on two semantic based methods used in our approach: semantic consistency checking and learning objects semantic space analysis.

The aim of this work is to support educators in the design process of computer game based learning experiences for teaching children about the risks of emergency. As an educational experience can be tailored to different student needs, the risk characteristics of emergency at hand, and the educational purpose of the experience, the proposed model includes the necessary elements to provide all this information. In this way the teacher can specify the requirements of the educational experience, and based on this information to propose possible configurations of the elements of the game.

Most e-learning systems require intervention from a teacher. The development of adaptive hypermedia systems, such as intelligent tutoring systems, aimed to reduce the teachers task. However, such systems are still at risk of inconsistently modelling the user when estimating a learners knowledge level. We propose a system called CBSR (Competence based System for Recommending Study Materials) which recommends appropriate study materials from the Web without requiring teacher intervention, based upon a competency model. This has the benefit of an improved pedagogical approach to e-learning, and a more consistent profile of learners competences which can persist though their life.

As Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) systems become more essential to education there is an increasing need for their creators to reduce risk and to design for success. We argue that by taking an ergonomic perspective it is possible to better understand why TEL systems succeed or fail, as it becomes possible to analyze how well they are aligned with their users and environment. We present three TEL case studies that demonstrate these ideas, and show how an ergonomic analysis can help frame the problems faced in a useful way. In particular we propose using a variant of ergonomics that emphasizes the expression, communication and use of knowledge within the system; we call this approach Knowledge System Ergonomics.

With the large uptake of online learning environments in educational institutions, students and teachers interact no longer solely face-to-face and are often geographically dispersed. Distance education can make it much harder for students to position themselves in the group of fellow students and to self-reflect on their work. The teacher can have similar problems by losing the general overview of the class, which makes it hard to discover potential pitfalls of students in time. To assist with this problem, we have developed a set of visualizations of learner activities to increase awareness and to support self-reflection. This paper discusses those visualizations and evaluates the usability and user satisfaction. From these studies, first preliminary results are available of the usefulness of the tool for the students. A planned future evaluation is discussed to evaluate the real usage and impact of the tool.

Game-based learning or serious game is becoming an important trend in e-learning research area because it seems address several typical e-learning problems such as high dropout rates due to frustration and the lack of motivation to continue studying and the cognitive overload of the learner. However, an important problem of serious games is the difficulty for instructors to adapt the storyboard, the scripts and the game levels of the videogame to new pedagogical objectives once the game development is achieved. This paper presents SeGAE, an author-friendly environment that offers to instructors a set of editors in order to modify the game design by defining new characters, objectives, victory conditions, authorised actions among other objects in the serious games even after the development stage. Particularly, we apply our authoring approach on Blossom Flowers, a serious game developed by Ktm Advance.

Technology is changing the way todays children learn. Based on our experience in the development of educational software for children, it is our belief that computer interaction should consider the factors that affect childrens cognitive abilities and take an active part in the realm of the methodological process of hypermedia design. Departing from the results of a preliminary study with pre-school children, serious difficulties regarding mouse interaction when playing computer games are detected, mainly in the movements requiring more complex psychomotor abilities, such as double click and interactions leading to dragging the cursor. The evaluation reports on the need to adapt the mouse interaction to childrens cognitive development, from point-and-click to drag-and-drop, and the suitability of introducing intermediate variations adapted to young learners needs.

This study investigated players motivation during serious game play. It is based on a theoretical model of motivation. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase of motivation during the game. This study tried to dissect predictors of Players Motivational States. Multiple linear regression showed statistical significance of specific electrophysiological data. The theta wave in the frontal regions and motivation were positively correlated. High-beta wave in the left-center region was also a significant predictor for high level of motivation. Skin conductance was also a significant predictor for motivation. However, we could not find a significant correlation between players motivation and their heart rate responses.

The training of soft skills in organizational settings has become very important for an effective communicative exchange between members of staff. Especially in companies where the line of communication has to be fast and unmistakable, e.g. in crisis management units, the regular training of communication skills is therefore indispensable. The DREAD-ED project proposes a technology-based teaching methodology to meet these needs. The methodology provides a serious game which enables its users to train soft skills in a virtual environment under safe conditions. The current paper presents the results of two trials conducted with crisis managers and university students.

This paper presents a framework for creating and conducting serious games. It focuses on role-playing game based learning scenarios in 3D environments. The feasibility of the presented approach is demonstrated by a training scenario for apprenticeship job interviews. Based on the assumption that reflection phases as an important part of successful learning processes are to be adequately supported, we show how phases of immersion during the role-play are connected to separate phases of reflection.

Game-based learning or serious games is becoming an important trend in the e-learning research area and seems address several typical e-learning problems such as high dropout rates, due to the lack of motivation to continue studying. In serious games, it is very hard to define and mix the learning situations with the game characteristics, and to integrate an assessment and guidance process of the learner without disturbing the game progress and maintain the intrinsic characteristics of the video game: fun, player motivation, immersion and interaction. In this paper, we consider the serious game as an asynchronous and concurrent system, and we propose an approach based on a Petri net to assess learners and detect misconceptions. In the game design stage, a discussion between domain experts, learning experts, and game designers is engaged in order to identify the actions in the game that imply knowledge acquisition and allow achieving the learning objectives of levels. Therefore, in our approach, the Petri net models only game actions allowing the learner to acquire knowledge. We use the reachability graph of the Petri net to track the learner in order to detect, in real time, the learners misconceptions, improve learner assessment and provide an accurate feed back for both the learner and the instructor.

The field of collaborative learning has been researched for many years with a focus on evaluation of the circumstances under which collaborative learning provides better learning effectiveness compared to individual learning. Traditional collaborative learning has been taking place as group work or discussions in a class. Recently, Serious Games for learning and Digital Educational Games (DEGs) have been established as a promising alternative to the traditional one-to-many teaching as it is still standard in todays classrooms and with the uprising technology of Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs), new ways of collaborative learning are possible. In this paper we examine various chances and challenges for collaborative learning which arise by the use of Multiplayer Serious Games. Section[1] motivates this work, followed by a description of some important aspects of MOGs and collaboration in Section[2]. In Section[3] the concept of collaborative learning is explained and important concepts and methods for a collaborative game design are analyzed and discussed in Section[4], using some examples of collaborative Serious Games. Finally, we briefly introduce our own approach of a collaborative Serious MOG in Section[5]. In Section[6] the results are summarized and further work is pointed out.

We present a study which compares human-human computer-mediated tutoring with two computer tutoring systems based on the same materials but differing in the type of feedback they provide. Our results show that there are significant differences in interaction style between human-human and human-computer tutoring, as well as between the two computer tutors, and that different dialogue characteristics predict learning gain in different conditions. We show that there are significant differences in the non-content statements that students make to human and computer tutors, but also to different types of computer tutors. These differences also affect which factors are correlated with learning gain and user satisfaction. We argue that ITS designers should pay particular attention to strategies for dealing with negative social and metacognitive statements, and also conduct further research on how interaction style affects human-computer tutoring.

We describe a web-based system that helps undergraduate students learn about research at their university through the medium of textbooks. The system, called University on Textbooks, links textbooks to research articles written by university researchers, enabling people to navigate between introductory materials in textbooks and specific topics reported in research articles. Bidirectional links are generated from semantic statements created manually for topical passages from textbooks and abstracts of articles. The semantic statements are created using an ontology that is based on a description logic, so a reasoner can infer the semantic similarity between pairs of statements. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we present a prototype containing 100 semantic statements describing passages from an undergraduate life sciences textbook in Japanese that have been linked to semantic statements created for 392 research articles from life sciences.

This paper relates to the effect of tablet PCs in e-learning. We performed analysis based on the , which models the information processing capabilities of humans. More specifically, we provided paper media, keyboards, pen tablets, and tablet PCs as input devices used for annotations during e-learning, measured the gaze point of each learner by an eye-mark recorder, and evaluated each device by setting memory and comprehension tests, giving questionnaires, and evaluating the note-taking. As a result, we have shown that the use of tablet PCs in e-learning 1) enables concentration on the content, 2) reduces the extraneous cognitive load imposed by making annotations, 3) increases learners comprehension and memory retention, and 4) enables efficient note-taking, thus increasing the accuracy of notes as learning aids.

Nowadays, there are multiple examples of technologies which can drive major positive changes in classroom settings. In particular, the flexibility of Tablet PCs and digital ink has the potential to achieve a wide range of educational goals and promote a more dynamic classroom environment. However, as the possibilities of these educational technologies grow, it seems necessary to consider their role by conceptualizing the knowledge they provide. In this work we propose an approach based on the use of conceptual maps to generate instructor guidelines for designing Tablet PC-based courses. Our approach combines the instructional domain with the technological one in order to offer practical guidelines to design and develop both lecture materials and active learning tasks, providing a systematic and flexible way to organize the teaching process in Tablet PC-based courses. The approach has been implemented in a pilot section during a first year Computer Engineering course with successful results.

Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) offer the potential to facilitate collaborative learning in new ways. This paper presents an empirical study that investigated the effects of a TUI in a classroom setting on task performance and learning outcomes. In the tangible condition, apprentices worked together around an interactive tabletop warehouse simulation using tangible inputs. In the paper condition, they performed the same activity with only paper and pens. Results showed that the tangible condition resulted in better task performance (more alternative solutions explored and better final solution) but did not affect learning outcomes, i.e. understanding of important concepts and applying them to a problem-solving question. We discuss reasons for this in terms of task structure and type, nature of tangible user interfaces and effective interaction requirements.

Formative eAssessment can be very helpful in providing high quality higher education assignments. However, there are obstacles restricting the uptake of formative eAssessment in higher education including both cultural and technical issues. When a university is encouraging the uptake of formative eAssessment internally it is useful to have case studies from academic schools detailing how academics enthusiastic about formative eAssessment have used it in their modules. It is particularly helpful if these case studies document: i.) the principle obstacles that these champions had to deal with, ii.) a cooperative-design process through which these obstacles have been dealt with by the champions (with assistance from e.g. learning technologists), and iii.) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting formative eAssessments. However there is a shortage of such real-world long-term case studies. This paper helps fill this gap in the literature by describing the case of a Modern Languages module within a Russell Group university (Southampton). The formative eAssessment solution resulting from the case study utilises our QTI, mobile QTI, accessibility, and web 2.0 tools and can be positioned at the cutting edge of formative eAssessment practice. We have evaluated this with undergraduate student volunteers from Spanish modules and received positive feedback.

In order to understand whether conceptual obscurity is truly the reason for the slow uptake of IMS Learning Design (LD), we have initiated an investigation into teacherss elements, teachers reported having difficulties understanding the concepts environment, property, role-part, and condition. We conclude that the specification per se does not present an insuperable obstacle for teachers, and that from a usability perspective the calls for a new or modified LD specification might be premature, since most obstacles can be overcome with appropriate abstractions in LD tools.

With the large uptake of online learning environments in educational institutions, students and teachers interact no longer solely face-to-face and are often geographically dispersed. Distance education can make it much harder for students to position themselves in the group of fellow students and to self-reflect on their work. The teacher can have similar problems by losing the general overview of the class, which makes it hard to discover potential pitfalls of students in time. To assist with this problem, we have developed a set of visualizations of learner activities to increase awareness and to support self-reflection. This paper discusses those visualizations and evaluates the usability and user satisfaction. From these studies, first preliminary results are available of the usefulness of the tool for the students. A planned future evaluation is discussed to evaluate the real usage and impact of the tool.

We present a work-integrated learning (WIL) concept which aims at empowering employees to learn while performing their work tasks. Within three usage scenarios we introduce the APOSDLE environment which embodies the WIL concept and helps knowledge workers move fluidly along the whole spectrum of WIL activities. By doing so, they are experiencing varying degrees of learning guidance: from building awareness, over exposing knowledge structures and contextualizing cooperation, to triggering reflection and systematic competence development. Four key APOSDLE components are responsible for providing this variety of learning guidance. The challenge in their design lies in offering learning guidance without being domain-specific and without relying on manually created learning content. Our three month summative workplace evaluation within three application organizations suggests that learners prefer awarenss building functionalities and descriptive learning guidance and reveals that they benefited from it.

Supporting learning activities during work has gained momentum for organizations since work-integrated learning (WIL) has been shown to increase productivity of knowledge workers. WIL aims at fostering learning at the workplace, during work, for enhancing task performance. A key challenge for enabling task-specific, contextualized, personalized learning and work support is to automatically detect the user personal tasks.

Contemporary learning design specifications are rarely implemented in learning platforms even though they would bring value to end-users. Unlike its predecessors, Simple Learning Design 2.0 (SLD 2.0) proposes a straight-forward and cost effective approach to learning design. SLD 2.0 was designed and implemented in a course management system by experienced learning systems developers, instructional designers and learning designers. SLD 2.0 proposes an XML binding usable as an unofficial add-on to the IMS-CC v1.0 specification.

In an information systems development course, it is crucial that students gain both conceptual understanding and practical skills. This is important due to the growing demands of industry for qualified software developers. However, the current teaching approaches fall short to fulfill these demands due to the way such a course is being delivered. In this paper we propose an effective teaching approach that relies on delivering theoretical and practical contents altogether in the lab rather than splitting them. We call it the integrated approach. It is based on the idea that students study the theory part in the lab and immediately execute a series of laboratory exercises implementing what they have studied in theory. We describe the details of the integrated approach and compare it to the traditional lecture delivery approach. Examinations final marks demonstrate that participants in the integrated approach outperformed those attended the traditional approach. We conclude by listing some disadvantages of such an approach.

The transfer and sharing of successful educational methods across countries is viewed as both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity is to benefit from the successful experiences of other educational systems. The challenge is how to transfer and adapt such educational methods. This paper proposes open source software a concrete transfer method of educational experiences. This approach is illustrated with an example learning management system originally built in Finland and recently made open source for Tunisian universities as a primary target.

This paper introduces a modeling language to facilitate the development of e-learning solutions in accordance with different pedagogical approaches, focusing specially in the support of collaborative learning settings. Usually, e-learning systems are very dependent on the technology, that determine or constraint the pedagogical approach that can be used. Educational Modeling Languages (EMLs) have been proposed to solve this problem. Typically, they are process-based modeling languages that support the computational modeling of educational units in accordance with different pedagogical approaches. Nevertheless, this solution is very complex as the language needs to cover many issues. The introduced language is named as PoEML: Perspective-oriented Educational Modeling Language and it follows a separation of concerns approach to simplify such complexity.

A key concern in game-based learning is the level of authenticity games require in order to match what learners can expect in the real world, what keeps them engaged in the game, and what they need to learn. We examined authenticity or credibility in a game from the learner behaviour and judgments on authenticity.

Non-governmental organizations often face the challenge that practical knowledge cannot easily be transferred between practitioners with different degrees of expertise, as there is no way of directly observing good practice, and practical knowledge often only exists in implicit form. In this paper, we describe how patterns may be used to support sharing practical knowledge, and based on the co-evolution model by Cress and Kimmerle, we provide a theoretical framework for describing how an exchange of practical knowledge takes place. We present the results of a case study that supports the efficiency of patterns. Patterns facilitate the exchange of good practice by leading to more explicit and understandable descriptions.

Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems provide an alternative to the  approach to web-based learning. It aims at enhancing e-learning experience with adaptive capabilities to accommodate for the different learning preference and learning aptitude of individual learner. In this paper, we discuss an Ontology-based Framework for Personalized Adaptive Learning (OPAL). Through the development of OPAL, we implemented an online Java programming course, which provides adaptive features through an ontology model and user model relating to user preference, progress and performance. The evaluation with students shows that the adaptive e-learning framework is more effective for university students who have online learning experience.
