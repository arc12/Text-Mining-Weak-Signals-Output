<h1>Rising and Falling Terms - CETIS Blogs Jan 31 2012</h1>

<p>This is an un-interpreted and automatically-generated report on emerging, rising and falling terms from the blog posts of the 

 CETIS Blogs.


It is one part of the <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/adam/2011/05/12/weak-signals-and-text-mining-i-an-introduction-to-weak-signals/">&quot;Weak Signals Analysis&quot; work of the TEL-Map Project</a>. The same analytical method is also applied to different kind of source data, hence the term "document" is used in plots; this may be equated to &quot;blog post&quot; in this report.</p>

<p><em>All plots will open in a new window/tab as 1000x1000 pixel images if clicked on.</em></p>

<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>The analysis involves the application of text mining to the text content of blog posts divided into two sets according to time:
<ul>

<li><strong>Target</strong>: blog posts published during the 6 months between Aug 01 2011 and Jan 31 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Previous</strong>: blog posts published during the previous 30 months (back to Jan 31 2009).</li>

</ul>
</p>
 
<p>Pearson's "Chi Squared" test is applied to determine the probability that the frequency of terms in both of these two samples could be from the same hypothetical distribution. The probability that the difference in term frequency could be ascribed to chance - assuming this hypothesis is true - must be less than 0.05% for a term to be presented in this report. This is referred to as the "significance threshold" below.</p>

<p>Further informaton about the text mining process being used is <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/adam/2011/05/12/weak-signals-and-text-mining-ii-text-mining-background-and-application-ideas/">available elsewhere</a> but for the purpose of interpretation it should be noted that &quot;stemming&quot; and &quot;stop-word&quot; removal has been used. &quot;Stop-word&quot; removal means that common words are removed before beginning the analysis. &quot;Stemming&quot; involves the conversion of similar words that differ only by their ending into a truncated form that is used as the &quot;term&quot; in the analysis. For the purpose of readability the shortest word that produces the term is generally given, although sometimes the algorithm fails and the stemmed version is shown. This should be born in mind when examining the results.</p>

<p>Four views on the differences between the Target and Previous sets of blog posts are presented:
<ul>
   <li><strong>New Terms</strong>, where this report highlights terms that meet the significance threshold and appear in at least 3 different Target blog posts but not at all in the Previous set.</li>
   <li><strong>Rising Terms</strong>, where term frequency rises by a statistically-significant amount and has an average frequency of less than 0.05% in the Previous set. A term must also appear in at least 3 different Target blog posts. The Rising Terms view focusses on possible weak signals, possible <em>new</em> trends.</li>
   <li><strong>Established Terms</strong> are similar to "Rising Terms" but appear with a frequency of 0.05% or more on average in the Previous set and hence are considered to be established upwards trends rather than indicators of a possible weak signal. Since this report is primarily concerned with Weak Signal detection, relatively little emphasis is given to Established Terms.</li>
   <li><strong>Falling Terms</strong>, are those terms showing a decrease between the Previous set and the Target blog posts that exceeds a significance threshold of 0.1% (a more lenient condition is used for falling terms).</li>
</ul>
<em>For Rising, Established and Falling Terms, the % change is calculated on the proportion of all stemmed words that are the term in question. For example if 2.00% of stemmed words in the previous set was &quot;learn&quot; and 2.12% pertains to the current set, then the rise is 6%.</em>
</p>

<h2>Summary Statistics and Overall Pattern</h2>
<h3>Corpus Statistics</h3>
<p>There are 101 blog posts in the Target set and 359 blog posts in the Previous set. Within these blog posts, which define the corpus, there are 10371 distinct terms after removing stop words and applying stemming. The summary statistics for the number of times each term appears in the corpus are: mean=9.871, median=1, maximum=1141.</p>

<p>For the set of New Terms:
<ul>
   <li>the number of times each term appears in at least 3 different blog posts the Target set but before applying the significance test has: mean=7.217, median=5, maximum=24.</li>
   <li>after selecting terms above the significance threshold, there are 8 terms in scope which appear in 28 out of the 101 Target set blog posts.</li>
</ul>

For the set of Rising Terms:
<ul>
   <li>the % rise in frequency from the Previous set to the Target set before applying the significance test has: mean=168.4, median=56.93, maximum=6668.</li>
   <li>after selecting terms above the significance threshold, there are 41 terms in scope which appear in 80 out of the 101 Target set blog posts.</li>
</ul>

The set of Falling Terms (the % fall in frequency from the Previous to the Target set) before applying the singificance test has summary statistics of: mean=-92.13, median=-100, maximum=-0.7337.
</p>

<h2>Auxillary Measures of Interest</h2>
<p>In addition to the primary measures of interest - statistical significance and the percentage change - two more are calculated as an aid to judging the actual, as opposed to statistical, significance of differences between the Previous set of blog posts and the Target set. The auxillary measures apply to the blog posts and are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>, which is a measure of how unusual the blog post is, based on the terms appearing in it, compared to all other blog posts in the corpus.</li>
<li><strong>Subjectivity</strong>, which is a measure of the fraction of the words used that are listed as generally having either positive or negative sentiment associated with their occurrence (the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm">Harvard General Inquirer</a> lexicon is used). A high Subjectivity is assumed to indicate the author's active interest rather than passive observation; active interest may correlate with weak signals. A subjectivity of 0.1 indicates 10% of the words (after removel of stopwords) have connotations of positive or negative sentiment.</li>
</ul>

<div class="cap-img"><a href="Images/AbsoluteNovelty.png" target="image_win"><img src="Images/AbsoluteNovelty.png" alt="Absolute Novelty" width="500" height="500" /></a><BR/>
Figure 4: Distribution of novelty measure among blog posts.<br/>Novelty= 1 - the maximum similarity (specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a>) between the blog post and any other blog post in the corpus.</div>
<div class="cap-img"><a href="Images/StandardisedNovelty.png" target="image_win"><img src="Images/StandardisedNovelty.png" alt="Standardised Novelty" width="500" height="500" /></a><BR/>
Figure 5: Distribution of standardised novelty measure among blog posts.<br/>A document with median novelty will have a standardised novelty of 0 and a unique blog posts a value of 1. Negative values indicate a document that has a closer &quot;neighbour&quot; than the median.</div>

<!--reset layout-->
<div class="clear"/>

<p>The Novelty Measure is particularly unreliable when blog posts are quite short, hence contain few terms after stopword removal, and if the corpus size is modest. In this case, the distribution of novelty scores is typically skewed towards a high value. In this case it is not realistic to identity truely novel blog posts, whereas a high negative value for the Standardised Novely is a reasonalble indicator of similarity.</p>
<p>The blog posts containing the highest novelty scores are <a href="#novelty_abs">listed below</a>.</p>

Blog posts outside the range of the whiskers are individually plotted as circles and are deemed to be &quot;outliers&quot;. The central bar indicates the median and the cross indicates the mean.</div>

<p><em>Note: In plots such as the above, where terms are shown they will usually be a short word but may occasionally be truncated or have an unusual ending. This is a consequence of the stemming process, where related words are rendered into a single form that is used in the processing. The word that actually occurs in a given blog posts may be one of the related forms. The unusual endings occur when the reverse-lookup algorithm fails. It should also be noted that punctuation is removed so hyphenated forms become concatenated. An unfamiliar term may be an abbreviation or project/product acronym.</em></p>

<h2>Correlation Between New and Rising Terms</h2>
<p>This shows how significant terms from either the "New" and "Rising" sets appear together in blog posts. The visualisation is created using <a href="http://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> (v0.8 alpha). Using Gephi provides for good interactivity; the <a href="Gephi/Significance.gephi">RisingTerm-Co-occurrence.gephi</a> file can be downloaded and used in Gephi.</p>

<h2>Significant Established Terms</h2>
These are terms with a statistically-significant increase but with a freqency of 0.05% or more on average in the Previous set and hence are considered to be established upwards trends rather than indicators of a possible weak signal. Since this report is primarily concerned with Weak Signal detection, relatively little emphasis is given to Established Terms.

Just a reminder that the JISC online conference "Innovating e-Learning 2011" is taking place next month from 22- 25 November, with a pre-activity week starting on 15th November.   As ever the programme is filled with a broad range of presentations around the latest developments in the use of technology, and some great key note speakers including David Puttnam (Lord Puttnam of Queensgate). Over the years I've found the JISC online conference really useful both for the range of presenters, keynotes and the mix of synchronous and asynchronous sessions and discussions.   Being online it gives a great deal of flexibility and no need for my usual 'silly-o''clock" start times to get to a conference.   A word of caution tho' - it can suck you in so don't expect that you can fully engage in  ...

I've been dipping in and out of the JISC online conference this week.  As usual, there has been a great mix of live presentations and asynchronous discussion.  Two themes have risen to the top of my mind, (open) educational practice and (digital) literacy.   I also recently attended the Mainstreaming Open Educational Practices Forum co-hosted by the OPAL and Concede projects and UNESCO.   So this post is a sort of summary of my reaction and reflections to issues raised during both these events.  Apologies, this maybe a bit of rambling rant!When working in any new or niche area, terminology and or jargon is always an issue.  I've always disliked the term "e-learning", and prefer to talk about "learning".  However I do realise that there are valid reasons for using the term, not least  ...

Assessment of language learning naturally presents some unique challenges for both teaching staff and learners.   Regular practice of both spoken and written language production is a vital part of language training and requires a significant amount of ongoing feedback to support the acquisition of competence in the subject.   In a distance learning context in particular, but similarly in any setting where feedback is provided asynchronously rather than face-to-face, providing meaningful feedback on spoken texts especially is challenging, often requiring spoken feedback to correct pronunciation and structuring errors.

When I was studying English at university, one of the more engaging and intriguing sites of discussion and debate was the margins of printed texts.   These are the ultimate asynchronous discussions, taking place over decades in some cases, rarely revisted by their participants once they&#8217;d left their comment on previous comments.   It was fascinating to encounter often very different perceptions on both primary and secondary texts, and they encouraged me to reflect on my own interpretations and arguments as well as articulating them in the form of comments added to those already there.   These serendipitous discoveries definitely enhanced my learning experience, providing the opportunity to discuss texts and solidify my understanding significantly beyond that provided by limited  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

All of us in the learning technology standards community share the challenge of knowing who our real customers are.  Discussion at the January CEN Workshop on Learning Technologies (WS-LT) was a great stimulus for my further reflection &#8212; should we be thinking more of national governments?Let's review the usual stakeholder suspects: education and training providers; content providers; software developers; learners; the European Commission.  I'll gesture (superficially) towards arguing that each one of these may indeed be stakeholders, but the direction of the argument is that there is a large space in our clientele and attendance for those who are directly interested and can pay. Let's start with the the providers of education and training.  They do certainly have an interest in  ...

The eighth project in Strand B (Evidence and Evaluation) of the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme is Evaluating Electronic Voting Systems for Enhancing Student Experience (EEVS), based at the University of Hertfordshire.   This one year project is undertaking an extensive review of the use of electronic voting systems (EVS) in a range of schools across the institution, gathering testimony from both staff and students on their experiences, insights and identified issues and success factors. Hertfordshire has invested substantially in assessment and feedback in recent years, with an extensive programme of innovations including the purchase of nearly four thousand EVS handsets for use in teaching in eight schools.   The initial response to their introduction, from both staff and  ...

Where the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme Strand A projects are focused on identifying and introducing new assessment and feedback processes and practices, the Strand B Evidence and Evaluation projects are reviewing the impact and implications of innovations and transformations that have already taken place, and exploring how these can be extended to new contexts and environments.   These eight projects cover a broad range of approaches and will provide invaluable insight into the value of such changes for institutions, learners and staff. The EFFECT: Evaluating feedback for elearning: centralised tutors project at the University of Dundee will examine the success of esubmission and their TQFE-Tutor system, a centralised email account, blog and microblog supporting their online PDP  ...

Over the last decade the volume and range of educational content available on the Internet has grown exponentially, boosted by the recent proliferation of open educational resources.  While search engines such as Google have made it easier to discover all kinds of content, one critical factor is missing where educational resources are concerned &#8211; context.  Whether you are a teacher, learner or content provider, when it comes to discovering and using educational resources, context is key.  Search engines may help you to find educational resources but they will tell you little of how those resources have been used, by whom, in what context and with which outcome.    Formal educational metadata standards have gone some way to addressing this problem, but it has proved to be extremely  ...

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.  For brevity, I'll refer to this as "the NOS Guide". The NOS GuideI won't review the whole NOS  ...

Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.

In December 2011, Version 1. 0 of "Information Principles for the UK Public Sector" (pdf) was published by the Cabinet Office.

The approach taken recognises that the principles will be implemented in diverse ways according to the context.  It is well written and full of material which strikes me as being widely applicable (not just to government bodies) in addition to containing a number of points that indicate a progressive attitude to information.  In particular, "Principle 4 - Information is Standardised and Linkable", gives me cause to nod with approval.

Assessment of language learning naturally presents some unique challenges for both teaching staff and learners.   Regular practice of both spoken and written language production is a vital part of language training and requires a significant amount of ongoing feedback to support the acquisition of competence in the subject.   In a distance learning context in particular, but similarly in any setting where feedback is provided asynchronously rather than face-to-face, providing meaningful feedback on spoken texts especially is challenging, often requiring spoken feedback to correct pronunciation and structuring errors.

The InterACT project at the University of Dundee, part of the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme Strand A (institutional change) is working on enhancing feedback dialogue, reflection and feed-forward in a large postgraduate online distance learning course in medical education. The course is unusual in that progress is heavily learner-driven: as students are working professionals they are able to enrol and submit assignments at any time they chose rather than according to a predetermined course timetable, and while this significantly increases the flexibility and accessibility of the course, this lack of external structure can impact, together with the higher attrition rates noted in online distance learning in general, on student progress and retention. Assessment feedback has  ...

Levels can be represented similar to other competence concept definitions, but need different relationships. I've written about how giving levels to competence reflects common usage, at least for competence concepts that are not entirely assessable, and that the labels commonly used for levels are not unique identifiers; about how defining levels of assessment fits into a competence structure; and lately about how defining levels is one approach to raising the assessability of competence concepts.

If you haven&#8217;t heard about Mozillas Open Badge Initiative, a great explanation and round up lives on Rowins blog.  As Rowin points out that badges &#8216;draw upon widespread use of badges and achievements in gaming&#8216; and as somebody who has many badges and achievements in various game systems I can&#8217;t help but wonder if some of the problems that have cropped up in games might cross over into the Open Badge Initiative.   Some early thoughts:Nobody wants to complete a level using only a hyperblasterBadly designed meta-goals can ruin an experience, some players will attempt to do all the tasks asked of them to get as many as the badges, achievements  or points as possible.  Is it fun completing any levels in quake 4 with only a hyperblaster? No, but it gets you a badge.  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.

For as long as I have been a web developer with CETIS we have relied on analysing server logs to give an indication of traffic sources and visitor trends.  This approach existed long before I joined CETIS and seemed like a logical way of doing things, CETIS has had many web servers and many different developers have installed different tools and resources and since they were all using the same servers and producing the same style logs it has been a reasonable method of producing comparable stats. While this method of collecting stats has stayed the same over the life of CETIS, the direction of CETIS and the environment that it finds itself in has changed over time and a need for a new strategy has become apparent.

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.  For brevity, I'll refer to this as "the NOS Guide". The NOS GuideI won't review the whole NOS  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

CaPRéT has been developed by Brandon Muramatsu of MIT and Justin Ball and Joel Duffin of Tatemae.  Brandon has now written a blog explaining how the team scoped and developed the alpha release of the CaPRéT tool and also how it works: CaPRéT uses the jQuery library and a jQuery clipboard extension to monitor the copy event on a given web page.  At the time content is copied, the extension adds attribution information that was parsed from the page using the OER license parser.  In addition, analytics are gathered at the time content is copied so that even if the user chooses to remove the attribution information the server still gathers  ...

I&#8217;ve been testing the alpha release of CaPRéT , a tool that aids attribution and tracking of openly licensed content from web sites.  According to the Caprét website. When a user cuts and pastes text from a CaPRéT-enabled site:The user gets the text as originally cut, and if their application supports the pasted text will also automatically include attribution and licensing information.     The OER site can also track what text was cut, allowing them to better understand how users are using their site. I tested Caprét  on a single page, my institutional home page and on this blog.  To enable Caprét for material on a website you need to include links to four javascript files in your webpages.

I think Pat has a point but also think there are differences between models that work for individuals and models that work for institutions.

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.

In the spirit of Godwin&#8217;s law, I would propose that&#8220;As any discussion about metadata grows longer the probability of a comparison to Google approaches one. &#8221;Of course the comparison is usually that formal metadata is insignificant for the resource discovery needs of most people when compared to Google. On one hand this is an over simplification: metadata is important for resource management in general not just for resource discovery, the information contained in metadata can be exposed to Google and other search engines, and it helps resource discovery in other ways, for example in displaying relationships between resources that can be browsed and crawled.  It remains, however, true that all the effort that has gone into formalising and standardising metadata schema has  ...

Over the past 18 months I've been having a series of discussions with Bill Johnston (a colleague of mine here at Strathclyde) around notions information and digital literacy and of what it means to be a digital university.  We moved from a series increasingly long, and wide ranging ad hoc "in the kitchen/pub" chats to slightly more formal meetings with the idea of writing a paper.   However, as the months have passed,  we've actually come round to the idea of extending our conversation in a more informal way, and (hopefully) to a wider audience via this blog.   In this post, I'd like to introduce you, dear reader, to Bill and the some of the key questions and issues we've been been working on. Bill Johnston is recently retired, but he is still an active Honorary Research Fellow at the  ...

Earlier today Amber Thomas kicked off an interesting discussion on twitter about which institutions had a reputation for openness in various domains.  One tangential thread from this conversation was a comment Pat Lockley made about the difference between openness that happens in connection to funded projects and openness that happens at your own initiative.  I think Pat has a point but also think there are differences between models that work for individuals and models that work for institutions. I&#8217;ll reproduce some of the conversation here, as it raises some issues. Pat: my take is, if it&#8217;s done off your own back, it&#8217;s open, else it&#8217;s just &#8220;of kernes and gallowglasses supplied&#8221;Me: there&#8217;s a place for funded stuff & sustainable open models rely  ...

We've done a great job with Leap2A in terms of providing a workable starting point for interoperability of e-portfolio systems and portability of learner-ownable information, but what are the next steps we (and JISC) should be taking? That's what we need to think about. The role of CETIS was only to co-ordinate this work.  The ones to take the real credit are the vendors and developers of e-portfolio and related systems, who worked well together to make the decisions on how Leap2A should be, representing all the information that is seen as sharable between actual e-portfolio tools, allowing it to be communicated between different systems. The current limitations come from the lack of coherent practice in personal and professional development, indeed in all the areas that e-portfolio and  ...

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

Last week I was at the first face to face meeting of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative technical working group, here are my reflections on it.  In short, what I said in previous post was about right, and the discussion went the way I hoped.  One addition, though, that I didn&#8217;t cover in that post, was some discussion of accessibility conditions.  That was one of a number of issues that was set aside as being of more general importance than learning resources and best dealt with that wider scope in mind; the resources of the LRMI project being better spent on those issues that are specific to learning materials. An interesting take on the scope of the project that someone (I forget who) raised during the meeting concerns working within the constraints of the search engine  ...

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Six projects were funded: CSAP OER, Oerbital, DelOREs, Triton, EALCFO, Open Fieldwork and a range of approaches and technologies was taken to making both static and dynamic collections.

Over the last decade the volume and range of educational content available on the Internet has grown exponentially, boosted by the recent proliferation of open educational resources.  While search engines such as Google have made it easier to discover all kinds of content, one critical factor is missing where educational resources are concerned &#8211; context.  Whether you are a teacher, learner or content provider, when it comes to discovering and using educational resources, context is key.  Search engines may help you to find educational resources but they will tell you little of how those resources have been used, by whom, in what context and with which outcome.    Formal educational metadata standards have gone some way to addressing this problem, but it has proved to be extremely  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

Along with around another 270 people, attended the eAssessment Scotland Conference on 26 August at the University of Dundee.    It was a thought provoking day, with lots of examples of some innovative approaches to assessment within the sector.  Steve Wheeler got the day off to a great start talking us through some of the "big questions" around assesment, for example is it knowledge or wisdom that we should be assessing? and what are the best ways to do this? Steve also emphasised the the evolving nature of assessment and the need to share best practice and introduced many of us to the term "ipsative assessment".

Providing fast, focused feedback to a cohort of 200 busy professionals undertaking vocational distance learning with tuition provided by a diminishing number of tutors, a number of whom are part-time, is definitely a challenging undertaking, and one for which the TQFE-Tutor system at the University of Dundee provides an innovative centralised approach.   The Evaluating Feedback for eLearning: Centralised Tutors (EFFECT) project, part of the JISC Assessment and Feedback programme Strand B, will be exploring the impact of this system and considering ways of further refining the process to maximise efficiency and student benefits. Students studying on the Teaching Qualification (Further Education) programme at Dundee since the start of the 2010-11 session have been supported by a centralised  ...

The InterACT project at the University of Dundee, part of the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme Strand A (institutional change) is working on enhancing feedback dialogue, reflection and feed-forward in a large postgraduate online distance learning course in medical education. The course is unusual in that progress is heavily learner-driven: as students are working professionals they are able to enrol and submit assignments at any time they chose rather than according to a predetermined course timetable, and while this significantly increases the flexibility and accessibility of the course, this lack of external structure can impact, together with the higher attrition rates noted in online distance learning in general, on student progress and retention. Assessment feedback has  ...

Like many others I'm becoming increasingly interested in the many ways we can now start to surface and visualise connections on social networks.   I've written about some aspects social connections and measurement of networks before. My primary interest in this area just now is more at the CETIS ISC (innovation support centre) level, and to explore ways which we can utilise technology better to surface our networks, connections and influence.   To this end I'm an avid reader of Tony Hirst's blog, and really appreciated being able to attend the recent Metrics and Social Web Services  workshop organised by Brian Kelly and colleagues at UKOLN to explore this topic more. Yesterday, promoted by a tweet of a visualisation of the twitter community at the recent eAssessment Scotland conference,  ...

As readers of this blog will know, I quite like experimenting with a number of services to record, represent and re-present various activities.   One tool I have been revisiting over the past few months is memolane.  When I first looked at this service I thought it had potential for projects and also as a  kind of corporate memory.    I've now started to use its "story" feature to record tweets and blogs from a number of meetings and conferences  e. g.  e-Assessment Scotland, EuroSakai,  and I've just pulled together my blogs and tweets from the recent Design Bash 11 meeting - see embedded story below.

Assessment of language learning naturally presents some unique challenges for both teaching staff and learners.   Regular practice of both spoken and written language production is a vital part of language training and requires a significant amount of ongoing feedback to support the acquisition of competence in the subject.   In a distance learning context in particular, but similarly in any setting where feedback is provided asynchronously rather than face-to-face, providing meaningful feedback on spoken texts especially is challenging, often requiring spoken feedback to correct pronunciation and structuring errors. There have been a number of exciting projects around audio feedback in recent years, including the Optimising Audio Feedback project at Aberystwyth University, Sounds Good at  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

Earlier today Amber Thomas kicked off an interesting discussion on twitter about which institutions had a reputation for openness in various domains.  One tangential thread from this conversation was a comment Pat Lockley made about the difference between openness that happens in connection to funded projects and openness that happens at your own initiative.  I think Pat has a point but also think there are differences between models that work for individuals and models that work for institutions. I&#8217;ll reproduce some of the conversation here, as it raises some issues. Pat: my take is, if it&#8217;s done off your own back, it&#8217;s open, else it&#8217;s just &#8220;of kernes and gallowglasses supplied&#8221;Me: there&#8217;s a place for funded stuff & sustainable open models rely  ...

HE institutions, from architecture and business to pedagogy and content delivery, have been designed for the classroom-based lecture model.  However, rapid technological change now means that lecture capture technology is becoming widely available and lecturers can easily record their presentations so that students may view them anywhere, anytime.  Millions of audios and videos of OERs have been produced by subject experts and are freely available at iTunes U for teachers and students to use and re-use in their teaching and learning.  And students can search and find most of the information they need on Google, YouTube and social networks via their mobile phones or laptops.

Meaningful work placements and graduate employability have always been an important part of university education and preparation for a professional future in certain disciplines, and are arguably even more so today in a climate of limited employment opportunities, with high university fees and loans positioning students as customers investing in their future careers.   Certain subject areas enjoy good relationships with industry, providing industrial placements to give students real-world experience in their future fields, while local companies benefit from the expertise and cutting edge knowledge these students can bring to the workplace.   Universities and colleges similarly benefit from this ongoing engagement with industry, ensuring their courses remain relevant and meaningful.  ...

JISC has a long tradition of providing support and encouragement for innovative assessment activities, recognising the crucial role assessment plays in education and the significant concerns about the current state of university assessment and feedback repeatedly revealed by the National Student Survey, stimulus for the National Union of Students&#8217; recent high profile Feedback Amnesty campaign. Their latest work in this area is focused on a substantial programme of projects funded under the three strands of the current Assessment and Feedback Programme, covering institutional change, evidence and evaluation, and technology transfer.   The twenty projects that successfully bid for funding under this programme address a wide range of assessment and feedback processes and educational  ...

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.  For brevity, I'll refer to this as "the NOS Guide". The NOS GuideI won't review the whole NOS  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

Relationship management is becoming increasingly important in the tertiary education sector as institutions try to meet the challenges of funding cuts and increased student and community expectations.   Employers and other external customers may have the potential to help the sector navigate through these difficult times, however good customer relationship management is necessary to maintain and develop such relationships.

Like many others I'm becoming increasingly interested in the many ways we can now start to surface and visualise connections on social networks.   I've written about some aspects social connections and measurement of networks before. My primary interest in this area just now is more at the CETIS ISC (innovation support centre) level, and to explore ways which we can utilise technology better to surface our networks, connections and influence.   To this end I'm an avid reader of Tony Hirst's blog, and really appreciated being able to attend the recent Metrics and Social Web Services  workshop organised by Brian Kelly and colleagues at UKOLN to explore this topic more.

Along with around another 270 people, attended the eAssessment Scotland Conference on 26 August at the University of Dundee.    It was a thought provoking day, with lots of examples of some innovative approaches to assessment within the sector.  Steve Wheeler got the day off to a great start talking us through some of the "big questions" around assesment, for example is it knowledge or wisdom that we should be assessing? and what are the best ways to do this? Steve also emphasised the the evolving nature of assessment and the need to share best practice and introduced many of us to the term "ipsative assessment".   The other keynotes complemented this big picture view with Becka Coley sharing her experiences of the student perspective on assessment and Pamela Kata showing taking us  ...

Martin Hawksey has been doing a bit of playing around with JISC project data lately and has now created a spreadsheet of the top "socially favoured" JISC funded projects.  As a large part of my job involves supporting and amplifying the work of JISC programmes, I'm also always looking for ways to keep in touch with projects between official programme meetings and feedback on reports.  Over the past few years, I have personally found that twitter has been quite revolutionary in that regard.  It gives me a flexible 'lite" way to build relationships, monitor and share project developments.  I've also noted how twitter is becoming a key dissemination tool for projects and indeed programmes.  So I was fascinated to see Martin's table and what sources he had used.

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.

I am only just getting my head around the area and hope that the session might be a hub for the experienced to share some of their protips.  I thought that by airing some of my questions and sharing some favourite resources might be a good way to get the tips rolling in and a conversation going before the event.  I guess that everybody at the session will have his or her own interests and questions  ...

Yesterday along with about 20 others I attended a Design Event organised by the Widg@t project, which is being funded through the current round of JISC Learning Teaching Innovation Grants (LTIG). The aim of the day was to help the team "define the design specification for the WIDGaT toolkit, in particular the Design Decision Maker and Authoring Tool interface. "  The team are planning to build a tool specifically aimed at non-techies -  " The WiDGaT toolkit (Design Decision Maker, Authoring Toolkit) aims to enable staff or students without technical expertise to easily design, develop and share widgets that support personalised learning.  It enables the creation of widgets that address particularly (but not exclusively) the needs and preferences of disabled students. " Splitting into  ...

What is the the future of technology in education? This is the premise for the FOTE conference which was held on 7 October at UCL.   And the answer is .  .  .  .  42, a piece of string?  Well of course there isn't a single one, and I don't think there should be one definitive answer either, but parts of the complex jigsaw puzzle were highlighted over the day.   A few suggestions which were aired during the morning morning sessions included: it's the standards and EA approaches on the latest Gartner education hype cycle; it's "cool stuff" combining the physical and digital world to create engaging, memorable experiences (as exemplified by Bristol Uni); it's predictive analytics; it's flipped and naked; it's games; it's data objects; it's the user - v - we don't know as we haven't figured  ...

HE institutions, from architecture and business to pedagogy and content delivery, have been designed for the classroom-based lecture model.  However, rapid technological change now means that lecture capture technology is becoming widely available and lecturers can easily record their presentations so that students may view them anywhere, anytime.  Millions of audios and videos of OERs have been produced by subject experts and are freely available at iTunes U for teachers and students to use and re-use in their teaching and learning.  And students can search and find most of the information they need on Google, YouTube and social networks via their mobile phones or laptops.  As a result of this ever-increasing student access to technology and online learning content, institutions and  ...

Along with around another 270 people, attended the eAssessment Scotland Conference on 26 August at the University of Dundee.    It was a thought provoking day, with lots of examples of some innovative approaches to assessment within the sector.  Steve Wheeler got the day off to a great start talking us through some of the "big questions" around assesment, for example is it knowledge or wisdom that we should be assessing? and what are the best ways to do this? Steve also emphasised the the evolving nature of assessment and the need to share best practice and introduced many of us to the term "ipsative assessment".   The other keynotes complemented this big picture view with Becka Coley sharing her experiences of the student perspective on assessment and Pamela Kata showing taking us  ...

Martin Hawksey has been doing a bit of playing around with JISC project data lately and has now created a spreadsheet of the top "socially favoured" JISC funded projects.  As a large part of my job involves supporting and amplifying the work of JISC programmes, I'm also always looking for ways to keep in touch with projects between official programme meetings and feedback on reports.  Over the past few years, I have personally found that twitter has been quite revolutionary in that regard.  It gives me a flexible 'lite" way to build relationships, monitor and share project developments.  I've also noted how twitter is becoming a key dissemination tool for projects and indeed programmes.  So I was fascinated to see Martin's table and what sources he had used.

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Levels can be represented similar to other competence concept definitions, but need different relationships. I've written about how giving levels to competence reflects common usage, at least for competence concepts that are not entirely assessable, and that the labels commonly used for levels are not unique identifiers; about how defining levels of assessment fits into a competence structure; and lately about how defining levels is one approach to raising the assessability of competence concepts.

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

I spent part of last week at the EuroSakai Conference in Amsterdam.    I haven't really had any involvement with Sakai, and to be honest, I've tended to think of it as a something slightly peripheral (probably due to its low update in the UK) and dominated by the US - a sort of "it happens over there" kind of thing.   However the community driven development approach it is taking is of interest, and over the past year we at CETIS have been making a concerted effort to engage more with the Sakai community and try and build more links to relevant JISC funded activity e. g.  the current DVLE programme.  Ian Dolphin's opening keynote gave a really useful overview of the history of Sakai, their vision of 'plugability' and ease of integration of tools and services.   The community continues to  ...

With the growth of the internet, mobile technologies, multimedia, social media and the ever increasing Internet of Things, the data we can mine effectively as well as the types of information we can process from that data are evolving rapidly.

The term &#8220;Big data&#8221; has emerged to describe &#8220;datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyse&#8221; (McKinsey, 2011).

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs.

Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.

System A needs to talk to System B.  Standards are the ideal to achieve that, but pragmatics often dictate otherwise.  Let&#8217;s have a look at what approaches there are, and their pros and cons. When I looked at the general area of interoperability a while ago, I observed that useful technology becomes ubiquitous and predictable enough over time for the interoperability problem to go away.  The route to get to such commodification is largely down to which party - vendors, customers, domain representatives - is most powerful and what their interests are.  Which describes the process very nicely, but doesn&#8217;t help solve the problem of connecting stuff now. So I thought I&#8217;d try to list what the choices are, and what their main pros and cons are:A priori, global Also known as de  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

All of us in the learning technology standards community share the challenge of knowing who our real customers are.  Discussion at the January CEN Workshop on Learning Technologies (WS-LT) was a great stimulus for my further reflection &#8212; should we be thinking more of national governments?Let's review the usual stakeholder suspects: education and training providers; content providers; software developers; learners; the European Commission.  I'll gesture (superficially) towards arguing that each one of these may indeed be stakeholders, but the direction of the argument is that there is a large space in our clientele and attendance for those who are directly interested and can pay. Let's start with the the providers of education and training.  They do certainly have an interest in  ...

An intial look at UKOER without the collections strand (C).  This is a post in the UKOER 2 technical synthesis series. [These posts should be regarded as drafts for comment until I remove this note]In my earlier post in this series on the collections strand (C), I presented a graph of the technical choices made just by that part of the programme looking at the issue of gathering static and dynamic collections, as part of that process I realised that, although the collections strand reflects a key aspect of the programme, and part of the direction future I hope future ukoer work is going, a consideration of the programme omitting the technical choices of strand C might be of interest.

In the UKOER 2 programme Strand C funded &#8220;Projects identifying, collecting and promoting collections of OER and other material around a common theme&#8221; with the aim &#8220;&#8230;to investigate how thematic and subject area presentation of OER material can make resources more discoverable by those working in these areas&#8221; (UKOER 2 call document).  The projects had to create what were termed static and dynamic collections of OER.  The intent of the static collection was that it could in some way act as an identity, focus, or seed for the dynamic collection.   Six projects were funded: CSAP OER, Oerbital, DelOREs, Triton, EALCFO, Open Fieldwork and a range of approaches and technologies was taken to making both static and dynamic collections.

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.  For brevity, I'll refer to this as "the NOS Guide". The NOS GuideI won't review the whole NOS  ...

This morning I was having a PROD call with Peter Kilcoyne from the WORDLE project (part of the current JISC Developing Digital Literacies programme).  One area that came up during our discussion was open source alternatives to SPSS for data analysis of their baselining interviews with staff and students.   Peter and his team have done a bit of research and have been looking at SOFA, and some other other possibilities.  Statistical analysis is not one an area I know that much about, but I know a lot of people who do have expertise, so I decided to take the tried and tested "lazy web" approach to see if there were any other recommendations from my twitter community.  And once again the power of the crowd came through.  I even got some email with more detailed information and suggestions of  ...

Over the past 18 months I've been having a series of discussions with Bill Johnston (a colleague of mine here at Strathclyde) around notions information and digital literacy and of what it means to be a digital university.  We moved from a series increasingly long, and wide ranging ad hoc "in the kitchen/pub" chats to slightly more formal meetings with the idea of writing a paper.   However, as the months have passed,  we've actually come round to the idea of extending our conversation in a more informal way, and (hopefully) to a wider audience via this blog.   In this post, I'd like to introduce you, dear reader, to Bill and the some of the key questions and issues we've been been working on.

I've been dipping in and out of the JISC online conference this week.  As usual, there has been a great mix of live presentations and asynchronous discussion.  Two themes have risen to the top of my mind, (open) educational practice and (digital) literacy.   I also recently attended the Mainstreaming Open Educational Practices Forum co-hosted by the OPAL and Concede projects and UNESCO.   So this post is a sort of summary of my reaction and reflections to issues raised during both these events.  Apologies, this maybe a bit of rambling rant!When working in any new or niche area, terminology and or jargon is always an issue.

In the spirit of Godwin&#8217;s law, I would propose that&#8220;As any discussion about metadata grows longer the probability of a comparison to Google approaches one. &#8221;Of course the comparison is usually that formal metadata is insignificant for the resource discovery needs of most people when compared to Google. On one hand this is an over simplification: metadata is important for resource management in general not just for resource discovery, the information contained in metadata can be exposed to Google and other search engines, and it helps resource discovery in other ways, for example in displaying relationships between resources that can be browsed and crawled.  It remains, however, true that all the effort that has gone into formalising and standardising metadata schema has  ...

One addition, though, that I didn&#8217;t cover in that post, was some discussion of accessibility conditions.  That was one of a number of issues that was set aside as being of more general importance than learning resources and best dealt with that wider scope in mind; the resources of the LRMI project being better spent on those issues that are specific to learning materials.

Martin Hawksey has been doing a bit of playing around with JISC project data lately and has now created a spreadsheet of the top "socially favoured" JISC funded projects.  As a large part of my job involves supporting and amplifying the work of JISC programmes, I'm also always looking for ways to keep in touch with projects between official programme meetings and feedback on reports.  Over the past few years, I have personally found that twitter has been quite revolutionary in that regard.  It gives me a flexible 'lite" way to build relationships, monitor and share project developments.  I've also noted how twitter is becoming a key dissemination tool for projects and indeed programmes.  So I was fascinated to see Martin's table and what sources he had used. Like many others I'm becoming  ...

As part of our work in the areas of open educational resources and data analysis CETIS are undertaking a new project  to visualise the outputs of the JISC / HEA Open Educational Resource Programmes and we are very lucky to have recruited data wrangler extraordinaire Martin Hawksey to undertake this work.     Martin&#8217;s job will be to firstly develop examples and workflows for visualising OER project data stored in the JISC CETIS PROD database, and secondly to produce visualisations around OER content and collections produced by the JISC  / HEA programmes.   Oh,  and he&#8217;s only got 40 days to do it!

For a while I have been wondering about the best way of creating a how-to guide around getting data out of the JISC CETIS project directory and in particular around its linked data triple store.  A few weeks ago Martin Hawksy posted some great examples of work he&#8217;s been doing, including maps using data generated by PROD, I think these examples are great and thought that they would be a good starting point for a how to guide. Don&#8217;t be put off by scary terms as I think these things are relatively easy to do and I&#8217;ve left out as much technobabble as possible, The difficulty really lies with knowing both the location of various resources and some useful tricks.  I&#8217;ve split the instructions into 3 steps. Getting data out PROD in a Google SpreadsheetGetting Institution,  ...

Summer generally provides a bit of time for reflection and gathering of thoughts.  It also marks the start of the final phase of the current JISC Distributed Virtual Learning Environments (DVLE) programme.    For the five institutionally based projects, this summer has provided a short break before some major implementations and evaluations get underway in the new semester.   This post summarizes some of the developments and future plans as outlined by the projects in their recent interim reports.

With the growth of the internet, mobile technologies, multimedia, social media and the ever increasing Internet of Things, the data we can mine effectively as well as the types of information we can process from that data are evolving rapidly.  In a recent report, McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the amount of data increase globally is roughly 40%.  The term &#8220;Big data&#8221; has emerged to describe &#8220;datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyse&#8221; (McKinsey, 2011).

HE institutions, from architecture and business to pedagogy and content delivery, have been designed for the classroom-based lecture model.  However, rapid technological change now means that lecture capture technology is becoming widely available and lecturers can easily record their presentations so that students may view them anywhere, anytime.  Millions of audios and videos of OERs have been produced by subject experts and are freely available at iTunes U for teachers and students to use and re-use in their teaching and learning.  And students can search and find most of the information they need on Google, YouTube and social networks via their mobile phones or laptops.

I'll gesture (superficially) towards arguing that each one of these may indeed be stakeholders, but the direction of the argument is that there is a large space in our clientele and attendance for those who are directly interested and can pay. Let's start with the the providers of education and training.  They do certainly have an interest in  ...

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

I've written about how giving levels to competence reflects common usage, at least for competence concepts that are not entirely assessable, and that the labels commonly used for levels are not unique identifiers; about how defining levels of assessment fits into a competence structure; and lately about how defining levels is one approach to raising the assessability of competence concepts.

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.  There was a good attendance of 35 people, just a few of whom I had met before.  Some members are ICT employers, but more are either self-employed or  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

The eighth project in Strand B (Evidence and Evaluation) of the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme is Evaluating Electronic Voting Systems for Enhancing Student Experience (EEVS), based at the University of Hertfordshire.   This one year project is undertaking an extensive review of the use of electronic voting systems (EVS) in a range of schools across the institution, gathering testimony from both staff and students on their experiences, insights and identified issues and success factors. Hertfordshire has invested substantially in assessment and feedback in recent years, with an extensive programme of innovations including the purchase of nearly four thousand EVS handsets for use in teaching in eight schools.   The initial response to their introduction, from both staff and  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

(18th in my logic of competence series)Having prepared the ground, I'm now going to address in more detail how levels of competence can best be represented, and the implications for the rest of representing competence structures.  Levels can be represented similar to other competence concept definitions, but need different relationships. I've written about how giving levels to competence reflects common usage, at least for competence concepts that are not entirely assessable, and that the labels commonly used for levels are not unique identifiers; about how defining levels of assessment fits into a competence structure; and lately about how defining levels is one approach to raising the assessability of competence concepts.

We&#8217;ve been encouraging projects in the HE Academy / JISC OER programmes to use  platforms that help get the resources out onto the open web and into the places where people look, rather than expecting people to come to them.  YouTube is one such place.  However, we also wanted to be able to find all the outputs from the various projects wherever they had been put, without relying on a central registry, so one of the technical recommendations for the programme was that resources are tagged UKOER. So, I went to YouTube and searched for UKOER, and this was the top hit.  Well, it&#8217;s a lesson in tagging I suppose.  I don&#8217;t think it invalidates the approach, we never expected 100% fidelity and this seems to be a one-off among the first 100 or so of the 500+ results.   And  ...

Martin Hawksey has been doing a bit of playing around with JISC project data lately and has now created a spreadsheet of the top "socially favoured" JISC funded projects.  As a large part of my job involves supporting and amplifying the work of JISC programmes, I'm also always looking for ways to keep in touch with projects between official programme meetings and feedback on reports.  Over the past few years, I have personally found that twitter has been quite revolutionary in that regard.  It gives me a flexible 'lite" way to build relationships, monitor and share project developments.  I've also noted how twitter is becoming a key dissemination tool for projects and indeed programmes.  So I was fascinated to see Martin's table and what sources he had used.

In December 2011, Version 1. 0 of "Information Principles for the UK Public Sector" (pdf) was published by the Cabinet Office.  The principles have been endorsed by both the CIO and CTO councils within government.  What surprised me is how good this document is. The approach taken recognises that the principles will be implemented in diverse ways according to the context.  It is well written and full of material which strikes me as being widely applicable (not just to government bodies) in addition to containing a number of points that indicate a progressive attitude to information.  In particular, "Principle 4 - Information is Standardised and Linkable", gives me cause to nod with approval. The standards message is not, of course, a new one for The Government; it is the inclusion of  ...

HE institutions, from architecture and business to pedagogy and content delivery, have been designed for the classroom-based lecture model.  However, rapid technological change now means that lecture capture technology is becoming widely available and lecturers can easily record their presentations so that students may view them anywhere, anytime.

Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.

In the spirit of Godwin&#8217;s law, I would propose that&#8220;As any discussion about metadata grows longer the probability of a comparison to Google approaches one. &#8221;Of course the comparison is usually that formal metadata is insignificant for the resource discovery needs of most people when compared to Google. On one hand this is an over simplification: metadata is important for resource management in general not just for resource discovery, the information contained in metadata can be exposed to Google and other search engines, and it helps resource discovery in other ways, for example in displaying relationships between resources that can be browsed and crawled.  It remains, however, true that all the effort that has gone into formalising and standardising metadata schema has  ...

 There were two themes running through this workshop organised by the Strategic Content Alliance: technical potential and legal barriers.  An important piece of background is the Hargreaves report. The potential of text and data mining is probably well understood in technical circles, and were well articulated by JohnMcNaught of NaCTeM.  Briefly the potential lies in the extraction of new knowledge from old through the ability to surface implicit knowledge and show semantic relationships.  This is something that could not be done by humans, not even crowds, because of volume of information involved.  Full text access is crucial, John cited a finding that only 7% of the subject information extracted from research papers was mentioned in the abstract.  There was a strong emphasis, from for  ...

In the spirit of Godwin&#8217;s law, I would propose that&#8220;As any discussion about metadata grows longer the probability of a comparison to Google approaches one. &#8221;Of course the comparison is usually that formal metadata is insignificant for the resource discovery needs of most people when compared to Google. On one hand this is an over simplification: metadata is important for resource management in general not just for resource discovery, the information contained in metadata can be exposed to Google and other search engines, and it helps resource discovery in other ways, for example in displaying relationships between resources that can be browsed and crawled.  It remains, however, true that all the effort that has gone into formalising and standardising metadata schema has  ...

Last week I was at the first face to face meeting of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative technical working group, here are my reflections on it.  In short, what I said in previous post was about right, and the discussion went the way I hoped.  One addition, though, that I didn&#8217;t cover in that post, was some discussion of accessibility conditions.  That was one of a number of issues that was set aside as being of more general importance than learning resources and best dealt with that wider scope in mind; the resources of the LRMI project being better spent on those issues that are specific to learning materials. An interesting take on the scope of the project that someone (I forget who) raised during the meeting concerns working within the constraints of the search engine  ...

The Technical Requirements for the JISC / HEA OER 3 Programme remain unchanged from those established for UKOER 2.   These requirements can be referred to here:  OER 2 Technical Requirements.    However, many projects now have considerable experience and we would anticipate that they would engage with some of the technical challenges currently ongoing in the resource sharing and description domains. We still don&#8217;t mandate content standards, however given the number of projects in this phase that are releasing ebooks we would anticipate seeing a number of projects using ePub.  We would be interested in: Your experiences of putting dynamic content into ePub format (e. g.  animations, videos)Your investigations of workflows to create/ publish multiple ebook formats at once, and of  ...

Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

System A needs to talk to System B.  Standards are the ideal to achieve that, but pragmatics often dictate otherwise.  Let&#8217;s have a look at what approaches there are, and their pros and cons. When I looked at the general area of interoperability a while ago, I observed that useful technology becomes ubiquitous and predictable enough over time for the interoperability problem to go away.  The route to get to such commodification is largely down to which party - vendors, customers, domain representatives - is most powerful and what their interests are.  Which describes the process very nicely, but doesn&#8217;t help solve the problem of connecting stuff now. So I thought I&#8217;d try to list what the choices are, and what their main pros and cons are:A priori, global Also known as de  ...

Over the past 18 months I've been having a series of discussions with Bill Johnston (a colleague of mine here at Strathclyde) around notions information and digital literacy and of what it means to be a digital university.  We moved from a series increasingly long, and wide ranging ad hoc "in the kitchen/pub" chats to slightly more formal meetings with the idea of writing a paper.   However, as the months have passed,  we've actually come round to the idea of extending our conversation in a more informal way, and (hopefully) to a wider audience via this blog.

I've been dipping in and out of the JISC online conference this week.  As usual, there has been a great mix of live presentations and asynchronous discussion.  Two themes have risen to the top of my mind, (open) educational practice and (digital) literacy.   I also recently attended the Mainstreaming Open Educational Practices Forum co-hosted by the OPAL and Concede projects and UNESCO.   So this post is a sort of summary of my reaction and reflections to issues raised during both these events.  Apologies, this maybe a bit of rambling rant!When working in any new or niche area, terminology and or jargon is always an issue.  I've always disliked the term "e-learning", and prefer to talk about "learning".  However I do realise that there are valid reasons for using the term, not least  ...

Earlier today Amber Thomas kicked off an interesting discussion on twitter about which institutions had a reputation for openness in various domains.  One tangential thread from this conversation was a comment Pat Lockley made about the difference between openness that happens in connection to funded projects and openness that happens at your own initiative.  I think Pat has a point but also think there are differences between models that work for individuals and models that work for institutions. I&#8217;ll reproduce some of the conversation here, as it raises some issues.

In December 2011, Version 1. 0 of "Information Principles for the UK Public Sector" (pdf) was published by the Cabinet Office.  The principles have been endorsed by both the CIO and CTO councils within government.  What surprised me is how good this document is. The approach taken recognises that the principles will be implemented in diverse ways according to the context.  It is well written and full of material which strikes me as being widely applicable (not just to government bodies) in addition to containing a number of points that indicate a progressive attitude to information.  In particular, "Principle 4 - Information is Standardised and Linkable", gives me cause to nod with approval. The standards message is not, of course, a new one for The Government; it is the inclusion of  ...

With the growth of the internet, mobile technologies, multimedia, social media and the ever increasing Internet of Things, the data we can mine effectively as well as the types of information we can process from that data are evolving rapidly.  In a recent report, McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the amount of data increase globally is roughly 40%.  The term &#8220;Big data&#8221; has emerged to describe &#8220;datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyse&#8221; (McKinsey, 2011).

Several of us in CETIS have been to the CEN Workshop Learning Technologies (WS-LT), but as far as I know none yet to a closely related Workshop on ICT Skills.   Their main claim to fame is the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), a simpler alternative to SFIA (developed by the BCS and partners).  It was interesting on several counts, and raises some questions we could all give an opinion on. The meeting was on 2011-12-12 at the CEN meeting rooms in Brussels.  I was there on two counts: first as a CETIS and BSI member of CEN WS-LT and TC 353, and second as the team leader of InLOC, which has the e-CF mentioned in its terms of reference.

I spent part of last week at the EuroSakai Conference in Amsterdam.    I haven't really had any involvement with Sakai, and to be honest, I've tended to think of it as a something slightly peripheral (probably due to its low update in the UK) and dominated by the US - a sort of "it happens over there" kind of thing.   However the community driven development approach it is taking is of interest, and over the past year we at CETIS have been making a concerted effort to engage more with the Sakai community and try and build more links to relevant JISC funded activity e. g.  the current DVLE programme.

For as long as I have been a web developer with CETIS we have relied on analysing server logs to give an indication of traffic sources and visitor trends.  This approach existed long before I joined CETIS and seemed like a logical way of doing things, CETIS has had many web servers and many different developers have installed different tools and resources and since they were all using the same servers and producing the same style logs it has been a reasonable method of producing comparable stats.

If you subscribe to any of our CETIS mailing lists you&#8217;ll probably be aware that each month I send out a newsletter summarising our blog posts and news stories over the previous month as well as information on our publications, events and sector funding opportunities.   As part of this I always include a Top Five posts section, highlighting the five most popular posts of the month - a really interesting look at what our audiences are actually interested in.   So with the new year now firmly in place, it seemed like the ideal time to take a look back at what you enjoyed reading - and we enjoyed writing - in 2011&#8230;What you liked readingThe top 20 most read posts of 2011 were:UKOER 2: Dissemination protocols in use and Jorum representation (26 August 2011) John RobertsonMobile Web  ...

Over the last decade the volume and range of educational content available on the Internet has grown exponentially, boosted by the recent proliferation of open educational resources.  While search engines such as Google have made it easier to discover all kinds of content, one critical factor is missing where educational resources are concerned &#8211; context.  Whether you are a teacher, learner or content provider, when it comes to discovering and using educational resources, context is key.  Search engines may help you to find educational resources but they will tell you little of how those resources have been used, by whom, in what context and with which outcome.    Formal educational metadata standards have gone some way to addressing this problem, but it has proved to be extremely  ...

(18th in my logic of competence series)Having prepared the ground, I'm now going to address in more detail how levels of competence can best be represented, and the implications for the rest of representing competence structures.  Levels can be represented similar to other competence concept definitions, but need different relationships. I've written about how giving levels to competence reflects common usage, at least for competence concepts that are not entirely assessable, and that the labels commonly used for levels are not unique identifiers; about how defining levels of assessment fits into a competence structure; and lately about how defining levels is one approach to raising the assessability of competence concepts. Later: shortly after first writing this, I put together the ideas  ...

System A needs to talk to System B.  Standards are the ideal to achieve that, but pragmatics often dictate otherwise.  Let&#8217;s have a look at what approaches there are, and their pros and cons. When I looked at the general area of interoperability a while ago, I observed that useful technology becomes ubiquitous and predictable enough over time for the interoperability problem to go away.  The route to get to such commodification is largely down to which party - vendors, customers, domain representatives - is most powerful and what their interests are.  Which describes the process very nicely, but doesn&#8217;t help solve the problem of connecting stuff now. So I thought I&#8217;d try to list what the choices are, and what their main pros and cons are:A priori, global Also known as de  ...

We&#8217;ve been encouraging projects in the HE Academy / JISC OER programmes to use  platforms that help get the resources out onto the open web and into the places where people look, rather than expecting people to come to them.  YouTube is one such place.  However, we also wanted to be able to find all the outputs from the various projects wherever they had been put, without relying on a central registry, so one of the technical recommendations for the programme was that resources are tagged UKOER. So, I went to YouTube and searched for UKOER, and this was the top hit.  Well, it&#8217;s a lesson in tagging I suppose.  I don&#8217;t think it invalidates the approach, we never expected 100% fidelity and this seems to be a one-off among the first 100 or so of the 500+ results.   And  ...

Assessment of language learning naturally presents some unique challenges for both teaching staff and learners.   Regular practice of both spoken and written language production is a vital part of language training and requires a significant amount of ongoing feedback to support the acquisition of competence in the subject.   In a distance learning context in particular, but similarly in any setting where feedback is provided asynchronously rather than face-to-face, providing meaningful feedback on spoken texts especially is challenging, often requiring spoken feedback to correct pronunciation and structuring errors. There have been a number of exciting projects around audio feedback in recent years, including the Optimising Audio Feedback project at Aberystwyth University, Sounds Good at  ...

The InterACT project at the University of Dundee, part of the JISC Assessment and Feedback Programme Strand A (institutional change) is working on enhancing feedback dialogue, reflection and feed-forward in a large postgraduate online distance learning course in medical education. The course is unusual in that progress is heavily learner-driven: as students are working professionals they are able to enrol and submit assignments at any time they chose rather than according to a predetermined course timetable, and while this significantly increases the flexibility and accessibility of the course, this lack of external structure can impact, together with the higher attrition rates noted in online distance learning in general, on student progress and retention.

When I was studying English at university, one of the more engaging and intriguing sites of discussion and debate was the margins of printed texts.   These are the ultimate asynchronous discussions, taking place over decades in some cases, rarely revisted by their participants once they&#8217;d left their comment on previous comments.   It was fascinating to encounter often very different perceptions on both primary and secondary texts, and they encouraged me to reflect on my own interpretations and arguments as well as articulating them in the form of comments added to those already there.   These serendipitous discoveries definitely enhanced my learning experience, providing the opportunity to discuss texts and solidify my understanding significantly beyond that provided by limited  ...

(16th in my logic of competence series)I've mentioned NOSs (UK National Occupational Standards) many times in earlier posts in this series, (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14) but last week I was fortunate to visit a real SSC&#8212;LANTRA&#8212; talk to some very friendly and helpful people there and elsewhere, and reflect further on the logic of NOSs. One thing that became clear is that NOSs have specific uses, not exactly the same as some of the other competence-related concepts I've been writing about.  Following this up, on the UKCES website I soon found the very helpful "Guide to Developing National Occupational Standards" (pdf) by Geoff Carroll and Trevor Boutall, written quite recently: March 2010.  For brevity, I'll refer to this as "the NOS Guide". The NOS GuideI won't review the whole NOS  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

I spent part of last week at the EuroSakai Conference in Amsterdam.    I haven't really had any involvement with Sakai, and to be honest, I've tended to think of it as a something slightly peripheral (probably due to its low update in the UK) and dominated by the US - a sort of "it happens over there" kind of thing.   However the community driven development approach it is taking is of interest, and over the past year we at CETIS have been making a concerted effort to engage more with the Sakai community and try and build more links to relevant JISC funded activity e. g.  the current DVLE programme.

What technical protocols are projects using to share their resource? and how are they planning on representing their resources in Jorum? This is a post in the UKOER 2 technical synthesis series. [These posts should be regarded as drafts for comment until I remove this note]Dissemination protocolsDissemination protocols in use in the UKOER 2 programmeThe chosen dissemination protocols are usually already built in the platforms in use by projects; adding or customising an RSS feed is possible but often intricate and adding an OAI-PMH feed is likely to require substantial technical development.  DelOREs investigated existing OAI-PMH plugins for Wordpress they could use but didn&#8217;t find anything usable within their project. As will be discussed in more detail when considering Strand C -  ...

&#8220;Preparing for a Thaw &#8211; Seven Questions to Make Sense of the Future&#8221; is the title of a workshop at ALT-C 2011.  The idea of the workshop was to use a simple conversational technique to capture perspectives on where Learning Technology might be going, hopes and fears and views on where education and educational technology should be going.  The abstract for the workshop (ALT-C CrowdVine site) gives a little more information and background and there is also a handout available that extends this.  The workshop had two purposes: to introduce participants to the technique with a view to possible use in their organisations; to gather some interesting information on the issues and forces shaping the future of learning technology.

Providing fast, focused feedback to a cohort of 200 busy professionals undertaking vocational distance learning with tuition provided by a diminishing number of tutors, a number of whom are part-time, is definitely a challenging undertaking, and one for which the TQFE-Tutor system at the University of Dundee provides an innovative centralised approach.   The Evaluating Feedback for eLearning: Centralised Tutors (EFFECT) project, part of the JISC Assessment and Feedback programme Strand B, will be exploring the impact of this system and considering ways of further refining the process to maximise efficiency and student benefits.

When I was studying English at university, one of the more engaging and intriguing sites of discussion and debate was the margins of printed texts.   These are the ultimate asynchronous discussions, taking place over decades in some cases, rarely revisted by their participants once they&#8217;d left their comment on previous comments.   It was fascinating to encounter often very different perceptions on both primary and secondary texts, and they encouraged me to reflect on my own interpretations and arguments as well as articulating them in the form of comments added to those already there.   These serendipitous discoveries definitely enhanced my learning experience, providing the opportunity to discuss texts and solidify my understanding significantly beyond that provided by limited  ...

(17th in my logic of competence series)The discussion of NOS in the previous post clearly implicated assessability.  Actually, assessment has been on the agenda right from the start of this series: claims and requirements are for someone "good" for a job or role.  How do we assess what is "good" as opposed to "poor"? The logic of competence partly relies on the logic of assessability, so the topic deserves a closer look. "Assessability" isn't a common word.  I mean, as one might expect, the quality of being assessable.  Here, this applies to competence concept definitions.  Given a definition of skill or competence, will people be able to use that definition to consistently assess the extent to which an individual has that skill or competence? If so, the definition is assessable.  ...

Badges can be seen as recognisable tokens of status or achievement.  But tokens don't work in a vacuum, they depend on other things to make them work.  Perhaps looking at these may help us understand how they might be used, both for portfolios and elsewhere. Rowin wrote a useful post a few weeks ago, and the topic has retained a buzz.  Taking this forward, I'd like to discuss specifically the aspects of badges &#8212; and indeed any other certificate &#8212; relevant both to portfolio tools and to competence definitions.  Because the focus here is on badges, I'll use the term "badge" occasionally to include what is normally thought of as a certificate. A badge, by being worn, expresses a claim to something.  Some real badges may express the proposition that the wearer is a member of some  ...

All of us in the learning technology standards community share the challenge of knowing who our real customers are.  Discussion at the January CEN Workshop on Learning Technologies (WS-LT) was a great stimulus for my further reflection &#8212; should we be thinking more of national governments?Let's review the usual stakeholder suspects: education and training providers; content providers; software developers; learners; the European Commission.  I'll gesture (superficially) towards arguing that each one of these may indeed be stakeholders, but the direction of the argument is that there is a large space in our clientele and attendance for those who are directly interested and can pay. Let's start with the the providers of education and training.  They do certainly have an interest in  ...

System A needs to talk to System B.  Standards are the ideal to achieve that, but pragmatics often dictate otherwise.  Let&#8217;s have a look at what approaches there are, and their pros and cons. When I looked at the general area of interoperability a while ago, I observed that useful technology becomes ubiquitous and predictable enough over time for the interoperability problem to go away.  The route to get to such commodification is largely down to which party - vendors, customers, domain representatives - is most powerful and what their interests are.  Which describes the process very nicely, but doesn&#8217;t help solve the problem of connecting stuff now. So I thought I&#8217;d try to list what the choices are, and what their main pros and cons are:A priori, global Also known as de  ...

In the spirit of Godwin&#8217;s law, I would propose that&#8220;As any discussion about metadata grows longer the probability of a comparison to Google approaches one. &#8221;Of course the comparison is usually that formal metadata is insignificant for the resource discovery needs of most people when compared to Google. On one hand this is an over simplification: metadata is important for resource management in general not just for resource discovery, the information contained in metadata can be exposed to Google and other search engines, and it helps resource discovery in other ways, for example in displaying relationships between resources that can be browsed and crawled.  It remains, however, true that all the effort that has gone into formalising and standardising metadata schema has  ...

Like many others I'm becoming increasingly interested in the many ways we can now start to surface and visualise connections on social networks.   I've written about some aspects social connections and measurement of networks before. My primary interest in this area just now is more at the CETIS ISC (innovation support centre) level, and to explore ways which we can utilise technology better to surface our networks, connections and influence.   To this end I'm an avid reader of Tony Hirst's blog, and really appreciated being able to attend the recent Metrics and Social Web Services  workshop organised by Brian Kelly and colleagues at UKOLN to explore this topic more.

As part of our work in the areas of open educational resources and data analysis CETIS are undertaking a new project  to visualise the outputs of the JISC / HEA Open Educational Resource Programmes and we are very lucky to have recruited data wrangler extraordinaire Martin Hawksey to undertake this work.     Martin&#8217;s job will be to firstly develop examples and workflows for visualising OER project data stored in the JISC CETIS PROD database, and secondly to produce visualisations around OER content and collections produced by the JISC  / HEA programmes.   Oh,  and he&#8217;s only got 40 days to do it!

For a while I have been wondering about the best way of creating a how-to guide around getting data out of the JISC CETIS project directory and in particular around its linked data triple store.  A few weeks ago Martin Hawksy posted some great examples of work he&#8217;s been doing, including maps using data generated by PROD, I think these examples are great and thought that they would be a good starting point for a how to guide. Don&#8217;t be put off by scary terms as I think these things are relatively easy to do and I&#8217;ve left out as much technobabble as possible, The difficulty really lies with knowing both the location of various resources and some useful tricks.

Are you wondering what to do with your OER next? Are you wondering how to keep the ball rolling in your institution and share some more educational resources openly?

Amazon are renting textbooks for the kindle.  Over the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been using a Kindle.  We bought it with the idea of seeing how it might be useful for educational content, eTextbooks at the most basic level, though I&#8217;ve already written about my misgivings on that score.  Well, we quickly came to the conclusion that the Kindle device wasn&#8217;t much good for eTextbooks: no colour, screen refresh too slow for dynamic content, not good for non-linear content (breakout boxes, footnotes, even multiple columns)&#8211;sure it displays pdfs and HTML, but it&#8217;s difficult to get difficult to get a magnification that works well and navigating around the page is clunky, and it doesn&#8217;t do ePub.

We&#8217;ve been encouraging projects in the HE Academy / JISC OER programmes to use  platforms that help get the resources out onto the open web and into the places where people look, rather than expecting people to come to them.  YouTube is one such place.  However, we also wanted to be able to find all the outputs from the various projects wherever they had been put, without relying on a central registry, so one of the technical recommendations for the programme was that resources are tagged UKOER. So, I went to YouTube and searched for UKOER, and this was the top hit.  Well, it&#8217;s a lesson in tagging I suppose.  I don&#8217;t think it invalidates the approach, we never expected 100% fidelity and this seems to be a one-off among the first 100 or so of the 500+ results.   And  ...
